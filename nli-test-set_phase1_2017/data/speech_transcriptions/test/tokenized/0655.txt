I found it really hard to get ready for the last exam at the university .
I was really tired by the time because of the previous exams I took .
And uh uh it was actually the last exam and they were supposed to score quite well to graduate .
The fact is that I failed and first time I did it unfortunately so I had to do it again .
Eventually I succeeded and uh it was really uh a great achievement for me .
Uh not only for taht effect but it took me so much time to get ready and to study and also the fact that I was so hard but actually it was like I I had already finished at the university by the time no matter the writing of the thesis .
