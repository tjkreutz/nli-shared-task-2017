I will suggest them to the Providence Island because it 's really beautiful .
Uh it has n't been transformed by man and beaches are the ocean is beautiful and also is apart from the main land where is all the violence and turmoil that is going on in the country .
Also there is like a huge variety and difference in the people that live there .
There are mostly Caribbean people , they speak on Patois the listen to reggae and is a really nice trip to the Caribbean I guess .
