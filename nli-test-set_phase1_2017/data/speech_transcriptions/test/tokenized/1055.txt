opportunity that was given to me was um my parents uh who paid um uh the fee for the TOEFL because um TOEFL was uh very important to me to show my lingui - linguistic skills to uh different university because I like to um to make my studies in Canada .
So I think that this opportunity was very is really important and I hope I 'll have a good grade so I can show um my good suitability to talk in English .
