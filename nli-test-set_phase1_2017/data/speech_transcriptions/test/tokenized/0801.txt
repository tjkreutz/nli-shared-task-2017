It 's my life , I have been playing this for almost seven years and hence I was naturally excited when I was given the opportunity to play an electric guitar for my class assembly at my school .
It gave me an opportunity to show my talent to my colleagues and my music teacher .
The tune I decided to play was a tune by a famous band Linkin Park and I really performed to my full potential .
It was a really op - opportunity which opened doors for my music career .
I found members of my band and then started out with a band named Four Directions .
I think it really helped me to forward my music career and for that I really thank my class teacher for giving me that opportunity .
