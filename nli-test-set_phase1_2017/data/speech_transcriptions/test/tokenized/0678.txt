If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country um I would suggest them to visit uh Brittany uh especially uh Saint-Malo uh because uh I have been live there uh for four years and I think it 's typically friends French and it 's uh very beautiful place and is historic too .
Um I think too uh it 's original and uh it 's unique in the road and uh I think it represent tradition of the French .
