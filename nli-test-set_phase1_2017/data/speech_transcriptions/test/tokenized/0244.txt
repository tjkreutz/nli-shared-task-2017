It was provided to me was I had to work as a team lead .
I had to be a team lead for a group of two to three people .
That was very special to me and an opportunity I always wanted for specially at the start of career itself .
It was a group of three to four people while I was being selected as the team lead .
I had to report to my managers , attend meetings , take uh important decisions .
Everything entirely was handed over to me .
It was completely on my shoulders and my reponsibility .
That was something which was a great thing that happened and I was really applauded for whatever I had and for my work .
So that would be the greatest opportunity .
And because of which it had really helped me in my future career and everything like .
So it 's something I 'll cherish .
