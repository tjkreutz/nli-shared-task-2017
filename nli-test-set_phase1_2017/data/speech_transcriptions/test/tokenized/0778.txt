An interesting book I have read is Nineteen Eighty Four By George Orwell .
It features the the futuristic of our world and it 's a quite pessimistic view on an about um it 's probably firm or realistic and we want to be uh and that it describes the world as an uh world in which governments are dictatorships and which really the rights are taken from the people and um everyone more or less fight for his own and there is almost no more social relationships relationships between people .
It 's um book that is pretty pretty pessimistic but I 'm afraid quite real .
