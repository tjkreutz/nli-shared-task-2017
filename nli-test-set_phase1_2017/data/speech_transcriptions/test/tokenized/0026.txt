Best opportunity what I was given in my me leading my school as a team leader .
It was a great and I have done a splendid job on my on my behalf .
And it was like one of the most beautiful time that I had to look after the entire school , and almost like around five thousand to six thousand people were under me .
And I was the only head from the male .
And since it was a co-educated school I had to look after every possible category from the the low grade to the high grade , from one to twelve .
And uh this was one of the beautiful experiences because my future is inevitably based on this .
