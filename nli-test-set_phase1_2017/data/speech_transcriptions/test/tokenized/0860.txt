A very good uh opportunity that uh I was given was a job I got in USA last year .
And uh it was important for me because it allowed me to uh experience different country with different culture .
And uh I was so happy about that because I was looking for a long time uh for an opportunity like that .
Working you know in a foreign country uh always help you to uh match your culture with culture of other people .
And uh you can see how many differences there can be , how people uh acts in different countries and that 's why I really love this opportunity .
