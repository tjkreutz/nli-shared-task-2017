I think that if a friend of mine uh would uh would go to spend time in my country , I will uh uh make him uh visit uh the city of Paris because uh I live near Paris and I think that it 's the very beautiful city .
I think that there is a lot of things to see , for example the Eiffel Tower or the Notre-Dame Cathedral .
For example , once a friend of mine , an English friend came and uh I uh brought him to Paris and he said to me that it was very delighted to have a come in Paris and to have visited uh such beautiful things and monuments .
