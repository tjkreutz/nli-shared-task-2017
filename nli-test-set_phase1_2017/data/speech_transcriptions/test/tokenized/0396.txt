The accomplishment that required me to work really hard was when I had to work for my family when my mother was ill .
She was seriously ill and had to go to the hospital because um at this time when she was in hospital I had to prepare a party for my grandma because she 's becoming eighty at this weekend eighty at that time .
And uh this was normally the the work of my mother then I had to do all the and all that stuff for the party .
And um the luck was that my mother was uh coming out of the hospital again when .
