Someone special uh someone to be member of a team would be would have to be the enthusiasm see there are people in in a group or in a team who are who have the knowledge they are the most skilled at various things but a person who 's really essential called me in a team is somebody 's full of enthusiasm .
He has he is the one can lift up this entire spirit of the team and when the chips are down and that helps a lot in that team coming up much stronger and much uh much more uh balanced uh when when uh when surface with a situation therefore I feel that enthusiasm is indeed a very very important com - quality that somebody needs needs to have in a particular team .
