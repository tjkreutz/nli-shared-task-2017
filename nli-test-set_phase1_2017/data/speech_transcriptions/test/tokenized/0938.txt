The most interesting book what I have read was Etiquette at Work Place .
It was mostly defined by how to work more aggressively and how to speak to our managers or our colleagues and many other persons who are the clients of the company .
It will improve our work skills , work abilities , how to improve ourselves at the workplace so that we can manage our work accordingly .
Not only that , whenever we do work , we just make some errors maybe fortunately or unfortunately so that being more aggressively at the work place .
