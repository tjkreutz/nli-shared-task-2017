I work very hard for my application for the university in England I 'm applying for .
Um I needed to gather a lot of information and paper work um to complete the application process .
For instance um references from professors of my universities which is quite hard at German universities because the professors do n't know you that well so they ca n't commend on you qualifications or your personal uh your personality .
So that was very hard to gather and I had to give all the relevant information the university asked for .
