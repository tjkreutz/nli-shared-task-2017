One of the most special opportunities that I got was to travel throughout Europe .
I went to France , Spain and London and it was a really great experience because I got to see the world , like different countries and different people and different traditions .
And I , that 's one of the things I mostly value because my family is also a really big mix so it 's interesting to see other people and how the live , to see their mix .
And I got to see like re - important monuments like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre and the Big Ben so I thought that was a really great experience .
