I think one of the most important qualities a team member must have is the ability to communicate with the other members of the team and also to people outside the team .
I think this is one of the most important characteristics because for one it it allows the person convey his ideas about the work being done .
It reaches the discussion , the topic the team is working and also because since a a team is a group of people , um the ability to communicate clearly not only about the topics being discussed about the work but about his feelings , is very important .
