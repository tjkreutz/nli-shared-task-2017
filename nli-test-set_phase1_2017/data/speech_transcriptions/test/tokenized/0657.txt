I think one of the qualities that makes uh person a valuable in the team is uh trying to work with everybody and not pointing fingers at people and saying that they 're the ones that are doing the things wrong .
But instead of doing that try and help them with what they need help .
And um just try not to get mad and scream at people and always try and work with any group not by himself .
Um to show leadership and uh do what 's best for the team , um always have a clear head and think appropriately .
