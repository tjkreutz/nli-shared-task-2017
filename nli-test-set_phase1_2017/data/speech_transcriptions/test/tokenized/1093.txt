The book that is very much close to heart and is very interesting to me is called The Load Road Less Traveled .
It is written by a psychologist called Peck M. Scott .
This book is very different because it is covered by a psychologist himself and hence contain the various different contents like a person 's religion , his beliefs in human and non human activities .
Human psychology is on various topics .
Discipline a human must follow and what he follows up to love and humanity .
He has illustrated various beautiful examples in his book .
One is that of a kid who has bought him a hug as a present .
It is beautiful .
