Special opportunity that was given to me was the GYLC , the Global Young Leaders Conference .
This conference is held in USA to build up leadership .
And the reason why this is important to me , is that I will have the opportunity to have my skills of leadership and I will also be able to meet my friends and learn about globolizations .
These friends who come from very different countries and will possess different cultures .
I will have the chance to exchange learn more about them and at the same time build up my leadership step .
This will help me to have a better skills in society .
