I think someone is a valuable member of a team when he or she um uh um works very hard for the goal together together with the others .
And is very tolerant so that he does n't exclude any other group member and if you you have a pure heart for his goal if he gives his best and if he go away to schools and yeah if he never stops thinking about what he 's doing and is um able to to give some ideas on how to get out of um um a difficult situations and if he 's whole thing .
