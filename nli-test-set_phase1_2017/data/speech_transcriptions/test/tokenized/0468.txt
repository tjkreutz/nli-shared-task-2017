Well an interesting book I 've read was called uh which is in German .
And it discusses the life of things uh when they were , when there was an invasion by the Europeans .
So it was very attracted by the fact other cultures life was shown in this book or how we think it was .
One of the biggest examples was that that they were on the one hand uh friendly commitment and another hand a war between the Indians and the Europeans .
