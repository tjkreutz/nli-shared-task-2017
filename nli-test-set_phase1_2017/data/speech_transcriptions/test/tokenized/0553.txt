Um the only time I remember where I had to work very hard was when my father was very ill and I had to stay at home and had to keep the household because my mother always went to the hospital to see my father and see how 's how he 's doing .
Uh that was the time where I had to work very hard especially because I have a little brother and I had to care for him and uh that was um not the best time in my life but there are no other situations where I had to work really hard so I 'm glad that that is the only one I could think of in that question and uh yeah , that was the only time in my life where I had to work very hard .
