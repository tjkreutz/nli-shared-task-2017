Among all the opportunities , the opportunity which was important to me was the industrial visit which was given to me by the uh principal of our uh university .
Um among lar - it was important to me because uh lar - among large number of students only few of them were given a chance .
And so I was one among them .
Uh in that visit I go - I got a lot of information about the project which I will take up .
And um it was a industrial visit so I have to visit lots and lots of industries .
So it help me uh in many ways so I feel it was greatest opportunity which was given to me among all the opportunities which I had ever uh received .
