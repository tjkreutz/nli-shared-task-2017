I think it 's important to be understanding the problem in the team is always that one person is for example very dormant and the other people they just say okay and um its also problem that um um a people the most people usually do n't care about team work so there has to kind of a leader so for everybody it 's important to be understanding to see that some people are good at these things some people are good at other things and um you then it then it 's possible to work together in a team and uh yeah that 's it .
