I think the best quality to probably to have is quality to be a leader because a leader is the person who can manage all the members of a group to go to uh as um object - uh and for example if a leader makes other things then then it make everything right so they will do what they have to do right and with almost no mistakes because uh he will know what to do and he will know what to tell tell people to do so everyone can do his job and then to apply .
So , I think that 's the best quality to for a member of a team to have .
