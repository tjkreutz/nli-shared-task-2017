Well I uh recently read uh the Da Vinci Code .
Uh it were it 's really , it 's uh a really an interesting book because it 's uh talks about uh Christianity .
It uh it showed that uh all the ideas uh we see about Christianity about uh Jesus uh the Jesus is the is the born without uh spiritually without uh a true a true uh without having having a real birth .
All all things all these uh things are uh are false in fact , it shows that uh the uh there are evidence about uh about uh rituals .
