Um I live in Michigan and for um friends from another country are from Germany would mish - would uh visit Michigan I would recommend them to see Detroit because that 's what I 'm familiar with and um Germans are not really familiar with concept of a shopping mall so I would bring them to shopping mall to the Summer Somerset Mall and indoor malls are not really big in Germany and that would be the first time of seeing a lot stores connected in one place and uh a big uh parking garage right next to it .
