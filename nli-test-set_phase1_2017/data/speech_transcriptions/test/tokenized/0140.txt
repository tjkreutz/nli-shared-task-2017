What I mi - miss most when I 'm away from your home from my home is the lack of the sea .
Uh for me the presence for the sea is really important thing because it really rela - relaxes place where you can relax yourself , stay with your friends and also uh uh pass present days .
Another thing that I miss from my home is the surrounding landscape .
I mean now I 'm living in a really flat places in European uh landscape but most important things for me is uh to be able uh to combine so uh uh present place with uh countryside .
