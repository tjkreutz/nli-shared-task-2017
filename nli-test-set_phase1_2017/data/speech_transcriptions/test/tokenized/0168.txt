I would suggest him or her to visit a very famous lake in China , Qinghai Lake .
It is the highest and most beautiful lake in China .
I had bee there last semester and some friend there treat me very friendly .
I like the lake so much because it has very charming visitor .
I mean the blue is so sky uh the sky is so blue and the sunshine is always uh is always there .
You can imagine how romantic it can ever be while you relax yourself o the grass near the bank when the sun is setting down and when the bird is singing , is very interesting .
