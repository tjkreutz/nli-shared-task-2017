I 've read a book about the Syntactic Error analysis .
This book deals with errors made by university students of English since this is their uh specialty and they have been learning this language for more than seven to eight years and they still committing mistakes or errors .
This books deals and examines these errors .
It is found that all student of English and Arab world they commit errors .
They are not committing mistakes because mistakes can be committed all the way .
They are committing mis - they are committing which is arising from lack of knowledge .
