My friend from another country come to visit me in Italy , I suggest the to go to visit Palermo which is a city in a south of Italy for two reasons actually , for the architecture and for the people and the situation um general .
The architecture in fact is as mix .
Like you can see the old and the new city at the same time , like walking in the center and you see just new buildings .
You turn the corner and you see a completely different landscape and people so are very friendly and they bring you to party and they help you to uh they help you to leave their and introduce you to their friends .
