Special opportunity that was given to me was that I was uh going to have a CEO as my teacher .
I think it was very important because the CEO can tell me what to do because uh I want to major in specific um area in my graduate school and I really do n't know about this at all .
So he can just tell me what this is ta - doing about so I can have my way of life .
Uh second , he is a CEO so he must be very experienced so he can share some successful experience with me so I can know how to do a thing very well .
