The job I would like to have for the rest of my life would be uh film director because it has been a life long dream for me .
Ever since I was a kid I 've always been odd by all the great films that I 've seen of my life .
And I fell that I 've always have the urge to be uh an artist .
And I believe that film making is an art within itself .
It is also referred to us instead of art and I love uh to fell the uh the creative process which a film maker goes through .
Not only with the actors and the acting and directing them but with the whole production design .
