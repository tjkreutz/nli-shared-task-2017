Right in that it 's very very important for the person to be understanding and open to different opinions .
When you are in a team and there are a group of people , obviously you are going to have diverse opinions and there are going to be many uh uh differences between what everybody feels about uh the subject uh hence but at the same time we can not uh rule out any opinion uh irrespective of whom it 's coming from because everybody is bringing bringing some value to the table .
Hence uh I think it 's uh very important that uh people are open to opinions and suggestions .
Thank you .
