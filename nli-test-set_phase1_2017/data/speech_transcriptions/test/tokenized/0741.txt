I was given an opportunity to gather children for a religious youth program by temples in New Delhi .
Uh this is very famous for its description of their religious ceremonies and their religious scriptures .
It is gathering young children to be more aware of their culture and the religious aspects of their life .
Most importantly , it makes the people realize the existence of the omnipotent almighty God .
As soon as people reach this seminar they have prayers depicting God 's praise and at the same time the priest praying to the Lord for the welfare of humankind .
It makes everybody realize that one should act as the at the level of the soul and not at the level of the body .
