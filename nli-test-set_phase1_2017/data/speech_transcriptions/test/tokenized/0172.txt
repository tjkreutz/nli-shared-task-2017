In my opinion I think it is very important quality for a team or group member is uh unselfish because unselfish is is important for a group .
They can take share others and play together is not only only something .
For example I have a good member in the in the department and team and then I would like I would say I would say I 'm so friendly with the team members and I will share the gift and the to be my punish and I would I would like sometimes I would in my spare time I would ask talk about .
