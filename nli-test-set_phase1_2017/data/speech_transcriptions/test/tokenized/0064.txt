I had an opportunity two years ago to get an education on economics masters sides in United States .
It was a great opportunity because my lawyer enabled me to get a scholarship that covers both uh my education expenses and living expenses .
So uh I was very happy when I got scholarship and uh I traveled to United States to see the orphanage live in Tennessee , and the school was very good and enabled me many opportunities to get education and also .
