If I were to choose a book that I found very interesting I would surely choose um The Economist by Stephen Landsburg , he is a well know journalist from the New York Times .
Um it 's a very very interesting book for many reasons .
Uh first of all , it 's very simple especially for especially for um books about economics which often boring and annoying .
So um for example , it describes very interesting facts uh bec - for example the slow down in the crime rate uh in the US uh could be due legalization of abortion .
It was very nice and I get the opportunity to meet its author in Chicago last year .
It was very very interesting .
