One opportunity that was given to me was to go to America to visit the uncle of a friend of mine and we stayed there for two weeks .
And his uncle was a professor at a college there and so I had a great opportunity to see uh US college from the inside and to have someone who is familiar with everyone and everything of the university there , and to show me around .
And so I got first impressions what uh US college was like .
And this also made me decide to to go within my studies for an half year to America to study there .
