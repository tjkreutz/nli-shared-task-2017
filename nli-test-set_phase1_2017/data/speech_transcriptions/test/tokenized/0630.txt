And the most important opportunity that was given to me was uh is the my bursary .
Uh I study in the university and I and I I take too much bursary from university .
That 's very important for me because uh during the university uh uh during university I can move out uh whatever uh I want and uh I can go wherever I want and I can buy uh everything I need without taking money from my parents uh and it 's a very important special opportunity for me .
