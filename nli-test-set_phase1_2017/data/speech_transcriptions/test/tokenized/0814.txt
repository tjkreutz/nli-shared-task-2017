The accomplishments that I required that required me to work very hard was the one that told me that I was n't able to work very hard enough .
This uh accomplishment was very uh serious for me because I knew that it was reality .
The accomplishment uh showed me uh the real reality which I knew before but which I did n't want to accept .
Therefore in my opinion , telling me the truth also it 's is n't the truth I want to have is the biggest accomplishment for me .
