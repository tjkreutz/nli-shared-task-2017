A very special opportunity that was given to me by my parents was the time that I want to study abroad in Canada for two years .
This was very special for me because I learned how to live by myself without the um without li - my parents taking care of me all the time .
I learned uh most of the English I know right now and I met a lot of people that are not accustomed to what I 'm used to from different nationalities .
