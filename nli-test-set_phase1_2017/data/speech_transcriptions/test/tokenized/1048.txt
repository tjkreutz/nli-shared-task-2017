The book I read I saw interesting was Robbin Hood .
I though it is interesting because it talks about very familiar and popular problems that that we are suffering in this world .
It was uh rich people where the rich people take the money from the poor just to make their dreams come true .
And re - regarding the poor and and what they have ambitions and dreams so .
