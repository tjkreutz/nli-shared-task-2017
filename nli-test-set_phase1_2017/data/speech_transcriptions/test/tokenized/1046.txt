One great opportunity which was given to me was working in Rome in a big graphic studio .
I um I loved this experience because Rome , first of all , it 's a wonderful city and the graphic studio where I worked was wonderful as well .
Uh the graphic studio was composed of about ten people and everybody was so kind with me and we managed to uh to help each other .
We , we often had brainstorming work together and we , we worked a lot but we also enjoy ourselves .
