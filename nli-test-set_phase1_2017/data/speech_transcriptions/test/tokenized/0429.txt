I would suggest the student to visit Tokyo .
Uh there are two reasons .
For first uh I live in Tokyo and I 'm familiar with Tokyo .
There are many places to visit such as Tokyo Tower Tower hills .
There are famous and interesting places to visit .
Also in Tokyo , there are many people who can speak English .
Not only English but also Chinese or French or other foreign languages .
So I think uh for my friends we can speak uh another country 's language uh it it would be comfortable to stay at long time in Tokyo .
