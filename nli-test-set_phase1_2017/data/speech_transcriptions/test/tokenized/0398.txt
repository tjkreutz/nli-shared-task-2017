City from another county definitely I would take to the Gold Coast .
Um the Gold Coast has a nice beach .
I think it is a beautiful beach , it 's unique to history of country and you can see the many shops and people who live there .
Um it is a very um interesting atmosphere and exciting especially the night beach is very beautiful .
Um also I would probably to her to the um Sanctuary to show her the wild animals that live in Australia as they are very unique and um they represent the county very well .
I would also show her around to the beyond the international shops that are very uniquely .
