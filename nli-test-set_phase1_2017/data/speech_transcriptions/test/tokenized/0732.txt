When I 'm away from my home , I really miss my mom because I love my mom very much and she too loves me a lot .
I miss the pampering , her care , her food , I miss everything .
Uh I also miss miss my uh pet , uh my pet uh my pet cat .
Uh I sleep with her and uh the my bed bed of course , my pillow every I miss uh when I 'm away from home .
With uh but the thing that I miss the most is my mom of course , her love and that 's what I desperately need to have to live comfortably and that works uh but pulls me back to my home every time .
I so that 's it .
Thank you .
