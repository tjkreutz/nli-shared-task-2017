Uh when I 'm away I miss a lot uh a part of my ho - home and is part is the garden .
I have a wonderful garden in my home so when I um uh I feel a little bit depressed I like to stay all the time in the garden and uh to to to see the tree and to work in the garden because I like so to make some gardening and uh I like to care to care the rose or or the flowers that I have inside my garden .
