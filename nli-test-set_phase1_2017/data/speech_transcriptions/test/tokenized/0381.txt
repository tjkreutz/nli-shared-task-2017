Uh there is two reasons for this .
One reason is that Kyoto is a place where um there are which represent the old culture in Japan and um there are lots of for example , there is lots of beautiful temples and so visitors can um can see uh they can see and feel a lot of uh lots of um old parts of Japan .
And the other reason is uh uh uh they feel uh seasons .
