When I was in middle school in eighth grade um I used to play the clarinet and one day uh my music teacher told me that I was selected to go to the special Arma Band in Luxemburg in a foreign country .
And um I was going to play there with other people who were my age and be forming a band .
And um and we were gonna be staying with a host family uh in Luxemburg and we were going to also get uh out the country and um get to travel a different country .
And I thought this was a very special experience for me .
I got to make a lot of new friends , and um it was great .
