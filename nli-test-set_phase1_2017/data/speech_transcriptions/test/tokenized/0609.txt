Uh what I miss most when I 'm away from home uh all my friends and my family with who care a lot about me .
Moreover , there 's my mother cooking for me and preparing meal , washing my cloth um .
Another aspect of leaving home is sharing the car with my family because I f - I do n't own any car so I I 've no flexibility when I want to go somewhere and of course there is my PC and my internet access .
