I feel that character is one of the most important characteristic of a member to be considered in it 's team .
Because character decides the person mentality and his behavior with the remaining team members and whether he is capable to support his team members and his cooperativeness and his mentality uh which affects other team members to be here with him .
And his character is one of the important thing which enables others uh other members to cooperate with him and uh enable to work with him .
And his uh be depending on the character , a bad character person can not be taken into a team since it is very difficult for other team uh members to cooperate with him and to seek any help for him .
And a true character is based on his ability to uh choose , talk and his way of his uh behavior with the remaining persons in team members .
So I feel that character is one of the important thing it 's just .
