I miss my parents the most when I 'm away from home because I miss mainly because I miss all the hugs and the cuddle , then all the love and affection that they give me all the time and whenever I want it .
Um the other thing that I miss is the food that is really delicious that my mom cook and then when I 'm away from home I have to either make it myself or go out and eat food which may not be .
And then the other thing , the third thing that I miss is the comfort of my bed .
I have difficult on a new bed with a new fellow .
So that is something that is the most and I mean the third thing that is uncomfortable to me .
Uh within that I try to enjoy myself and make use of the time that .
