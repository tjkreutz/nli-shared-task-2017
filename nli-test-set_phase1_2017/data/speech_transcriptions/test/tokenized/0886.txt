My example any person should be confident , disciplined or to manage the team because if the person is not confident he can not he can not let the team members be confident enough .
For example a captain even if he loses the game he needs to some confidence into the team members so that they wo n't be disgraces in the future and disciple plays and equal and important role because without discipline there is nothing a person can do .
And team work is the most important thing is a captain or a member can see that the team works as a team instead of persons it is very good .
