When I away from my home , I really miss a lot of things .
The first thing that I miss is the support from the parents when I am in trouble .
They always help me in a very small very uh this uh very clear manner .
They clear all my confusions , they really help me .
The second thing that I miss in is my living room .
I really enjoy sitting in it because it contains so many things and uh like a television which would love watching and uh a beautiful chair in which I really feel comfortable .
The last thing that I miss is the uh the last thing that I miss the food the food is made by my mother .
I really enjoy eating it .
