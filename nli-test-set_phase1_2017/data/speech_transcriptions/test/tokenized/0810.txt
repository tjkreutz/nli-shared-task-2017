If I could have a job or career that I wanted , I would choose something in the field of a research and most probably in the field of science .
Um maybe something like uh developing new cures for diseases uh de - deadly diseases like cancer and aids .
Uh and so far inventing something which will actually uh help help uh man kind uh as a whole because I think uh people that uh help man kind uh just live their lives and also it would be um , be a greater contribution towards the man kind and also uh uh let me have a satisfaction of the job that I do .
