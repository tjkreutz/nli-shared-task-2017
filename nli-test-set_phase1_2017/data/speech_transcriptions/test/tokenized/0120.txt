What I miss most when I 'm away from my home is the most of the times the climate because I think it 's very different from my region for example , from France to China .
It 's more wet in China .
And also my parents and my brother it 's very hard to not being with them and to discuss with them .
So I also miss the comfort of my home sometimes and with lower comfort in a different country and especially also the food .
For example , I give Fr - French food which is , which is the liver of duck and goo - of goose and we really like it in France and we do n't have that in the other country or the one a specific one while from others and all that kind of food .
