My hometown is the city of Booval which is located in Central India .
Is the largest big city with many lakes .
For this reason it 's also called the Lake City .
It 's very beautiful and therefore I also miss the lakes and the green land .
Secondly , I also miss the traditional food that I used to get there cooked by my grandmother .
It was very tasty and which I normally do n't get when I 'm outside of the city .
Also I miss my school and the students and my friends .
The people in the city are very nice and friendly .
They help you whenever you want help .
And so I believe that 's a beautiful city to live in and therefore I would love to go there again and again .
