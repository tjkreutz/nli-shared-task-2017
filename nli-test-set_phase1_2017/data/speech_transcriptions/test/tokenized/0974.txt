One of the greatest opportunity I was given was uh my trip in the United States .
Even though I have my parents there um that was great experience because I could approach with a new kind of life and new world , new people , um some friends that uh I had not here in Italy .
It was also very important because I could afford with the my lan - the English language and so could inspire to improve the way I could speak .
Um then it was also important because I could manage to see my best friends again .
