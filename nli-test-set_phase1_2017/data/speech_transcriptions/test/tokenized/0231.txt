Once I was given uh an opportunity to take uh to take a cour - to take a cooking course in my school and I learned to cook my signature fish which is the signature dish which is a sweet and sour fish which is uh traditional Chinese dish .
Um although I have read in books that fish is special in Chinese culture and people believe it will bring good fortune , I never imagined that I can made it by myself .
First , I fully fry the fish and I mix it with a special sweet and sour sauce so it tastes delicious and looks inviting .
I still remember the excitement my mo - when my mother first ate it .
It now is my signature fish and I .
