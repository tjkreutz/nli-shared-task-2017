I got a I got a sp - I got a special opportunity when I was in eighth grade .
My father uh allowed me to go study in the foreign country , to New Zealand .
From there I faced a different culture and different people and I learn their own language , English .
Then I studied hard and then I could learn a lot of various different people and I could learn the new culture and I could expand my perspective .
