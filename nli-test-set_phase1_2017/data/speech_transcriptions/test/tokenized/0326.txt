The most important qualities or working as in a team would require a team members to be very helpful firstly .
Uh if the person is not helpful it would be difficult to work together as a team and to accomplish the assigned tasks .
Another important quality would be sharing and coherently working the working out the requirements .
If you 're not sharing the information and you are on your own pace at your time it would be difficult to achieve the tasks as well as no or keep track of what is happening .
Another quality which I think would be most important is respect for all the other team members .
That way you will be able to respect and value their opinion and achieve are uh the expected tasks in time .
