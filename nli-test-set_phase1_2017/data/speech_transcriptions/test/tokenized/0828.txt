Well one of my opportunities that was very special is studying abroad .
My parents allowed me to go study in the UK .
Um why I consider it special is because the education over there is way better .
It can be a really new experience uh living by himself in an apartment depending on yourself , in other words being independent .
New culture , meeting new people making new friends as well and uh learning new stuff and as well as new experiences .
