A special opportunity that was like given to me was recently working as a dean 's assistant .
I s - finished studying architecture so my dean was an architect gave me an opportunity to work in a project of investigating different urban planning in my country specifically in the city where I live , working .
And this opportunity gave me the chance for me to show what I 've had learnt in the past fi - five years study in my career and it can also lead me to choose what master 's degree I am planning on doing um that is master 's degree in landscaping .
