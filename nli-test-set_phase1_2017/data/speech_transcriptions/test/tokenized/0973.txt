Friends from an - another country were going to spend some time in my country , I definitely take them to Mexico City .
I take them to Mexico city because two main reasons .
The first one is because is the biggest city in the world and there you can do which ever activity you want to do .
You can go from to Americado or go shopping to have a dinner in a fancy restaurant .
And the second reason , because I took them there it 's because I 've been living there all my life and I think I know pretty well my city .
So I could be able to take them to anywhere or satisfy any any anything they wanna do .
