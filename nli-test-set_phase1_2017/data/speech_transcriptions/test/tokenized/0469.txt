I really worked hard at our festival of uh our sports club and association teaching where we had organized a tournament for volleyball and for gymnastics .
This was really important for me because I 'd like to help uh children doing sports and encourage them to take part in events of our association .
This is really important to uh achieve team building and to form social skills .
So um it is also important uh to work together and not alone and this you can see in a festival .
