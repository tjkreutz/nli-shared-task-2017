The most interesting book I ever read is uh My Century from GÃ¼nter Grass .
I read it uh uh in French but it 's a German writer and I think it 's quite interesting because it tal - uh all about the other century through uh the view of different people speaking of different years .
So the evolution is quite uh interesting to see and it 's a German point of views uh with the story of wars and they are , maybe the the fact that they feel guilty about some part of the story .
I thought it was very well written and quite interesting to read .
So yeah so a book I will recommend to a lot of people who have the chance to to read .
