I believe team spirit is the best thing that one should be having in a t - in is in a team for it is very important in the team you will be having many people with different different feelings , different opinions , different ideas .
When you 're in the team you have to get adjust to all the people and then everyone and good progress in the team .
So therefore a team uh in the team , one should be having a team spirit to continue .
It also includes and it also tells you what the best many reasons that you have , best etiquettes that you 're in you 're in the team .
