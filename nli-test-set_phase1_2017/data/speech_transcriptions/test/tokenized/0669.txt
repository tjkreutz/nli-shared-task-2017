My parents gave me the opportunity to study at the University of Vienna which is very important for me because I think it will help me in future and um I think education is very important .
It also gives me the opportunity to apply for a semester abroad which will give me the opportunity to meet um lots of new people and make experiences that not everybody has possibility to make .
And therefore I 'm very thankful to my parents who pay study for me .
