The most interesting book that I have read is The Man from Mars , Women from Venus .
This book describes the different characteristics of women and men and how they differ and also on relation to their different roles as well .
Also the um the uh most interesting thing about the the book it says how communications differs among the two genders based on their um uh based on their different characteristics and how to uh make communication become better and make even relationships whether a marriage relationships or even any type of other communication be more successful .
Um the book um describes that woman they are more uh willing to talk and discuss .
