One of the most important opportunity that I was was being given to me was uh to work for a European agency in Italy .
I was selected to work as administrative support in this European agency and it was very important because uh the agency allows me to speak in English uh every day even if I 'm in Italy and to to work in multicultural environment and so surrounded by people different cultures .
And um then it was very important also because uh it was big challenge for me because I 'm graduated uh in two thousand and four so after one year I 've got this job and was really amazing to to enter .
