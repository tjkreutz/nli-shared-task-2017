Well I suggest that they visit Kyoto Japan .
We are one of the oldest city in Japan and there is two reason for my answer .
Uh one is , there is a lot of historical structure uh including the Temple and a lot of Japanese castle .
And the second the lot of Japanese traditional foods they can eat .
That why I recommend the best in Japan .
