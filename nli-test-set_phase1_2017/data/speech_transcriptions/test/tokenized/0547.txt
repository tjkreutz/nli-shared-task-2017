I miss the full uh the most about I miss the food mostly when I 'm away as I 'm staying in a hostel .
So the food quality in the mess is very bad and the cook uh the cook prepares food very bad in bad manner .
And also I I miss the affection and uh and care of parents during uh the s - during the stay out of my home .
Uh the best part is the food at home .
