There are many jobs I like to do in my career .
If I had only choose one it would be a journalist .
To be a journalist um um you can uh report the news uh , all the big events in the world or your country to people around world is very influential .
And uh to be a journalist uh you have a chance to uh interview with a lot of people and they can be uh artist and politicians , um soldiers and uh a very famous one or very ones .
It 's very interesting and exciting experience .
