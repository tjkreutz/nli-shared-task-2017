Um when I was in Russia I had an opportunity to um help around um as a peer helper to the new kids around the school .
And it was a great opportunity for me to get to know new kids around the school and to communicate with various people .
Um it increased my social life with my friends around the school and it was a great opportunity for me to get in touch with the new people in school .
