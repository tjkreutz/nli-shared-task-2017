Was probably um that I had a chance to become an exchange student in two thousand and five and two thousand and six .
Um to be an exchange student in the United States .
Um I had a chance to learn lots of things about the American culture and to learn about the way American people think .
And therefore I made a goal to come back to United States and study there which led me to take this test and to study very hard in order to reach my goal .
Therefore I would love to study in the United States .
