the opportunity that I was given was building a website for my college .
I was told to partake in a team of three .
Um this opportunity was very important for me because it involved implementing the skills which I already had acquired .
It was also important because it made me do something for my college which I always wanted to do .
It also helped me in recognition in my college as a website is seen by almost everyone in the college and even people who are trying to get inward to it .
That is why my this opportunity I consider it as very important .
