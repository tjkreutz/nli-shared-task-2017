I miss most when I 'm away when I 'm away from home and my friends because I 'm very connected to my friends and we have a lot in common and we often go out .
This may it means in this .
Then of course I also miss my parents because I 'm really connected to my parents and uh we have always a lot of f - fun together and we go out together and we have dinner together .
It 's so important to me .
Then of course I miss the food because um I like my food at home and if I 'm away it 's always it 's a bit difficult for me to get the food I like and of course I miss my pet because my dog is really important to me we 're close friends and .
