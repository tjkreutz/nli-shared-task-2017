I would suggest to visit Berlin the capital of Germany because in this capital I can show the young history of Germany .
Uh and this history uh German was separated in two different parts the GDR and the BRD and I think that this can be shown uh on the best way in the best way in Berlin .
On the other hand you can visit many different uh museums about the history and you can visit also uh theaters and uh streets from .
