An interesting book I 've read is called Brave New World .
Um I thought it was interesting first of all because I had to read it to prepare for my A levels and I knew that it would be in there so I had to be really concerned about it and read it carefully .
By reading it carefully I found it very interesting because I imagined being in a society like that .
It was a sos - society with with different classes in which several classes were superior to the other classes which would be to the .
So I imagined myself being in that society and being either in an upper in a lower class .
This is what I found very interesting .
That 's why I like Brave New World a lot .
