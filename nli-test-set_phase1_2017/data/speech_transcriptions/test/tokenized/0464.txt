The job or career I c - wanted , I would choose to be a ENT doctor .

My sinus get congested a lot of times when I catch cold and uh when the season changes um so I want to learn how and why so I can help myself out .
The second of all is uh as a ENT doctor , I will have I will be well paid and uh have a lot of salaries and the money and time that I can travel around and I also have a friend I know that uh which is a doctor .
He always have uh lot of pays .
And also , there 's the third reason is the environment will be less stressful .
