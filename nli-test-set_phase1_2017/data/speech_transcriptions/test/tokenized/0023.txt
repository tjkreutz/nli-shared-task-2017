Opportunity that was given to me was uh uh the chance to be in France , Paris .
Uh I obviously I could learn French over there and making many friends and good people um where I was .
And I have still co - good contacts with them It 's a great pleasure to have known them .
Also I could visit um museums and beautiful landmarks over there .
And it gave me a lot of um wonderful memories and uh such a precious feelings .
Still I can feel it whenever I think about France .
