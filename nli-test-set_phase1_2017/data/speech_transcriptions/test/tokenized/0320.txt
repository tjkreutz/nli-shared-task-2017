I was allowed to teach English for the class when I was in fourth grade .
And that time I left overseas and so the teacher thought my prof - pronunciation was good .
And so I had troubles speaking in front of peoples but she kept on allowing me coming up front and speak for the class and it helped me speaking in front of people .
And so I practiced a lot from then on , speaking in front of people .
And it was a good opportunity to have confes - confidence in myself .
And so that 's why I think it was special to me .
