I suggest that they visit the city of Beijing because it is the capital of China and there are a lots of places of interest in the city of Beijing .
For example , The Great Wall , the palaces of ancient kings and uh if they visit these places , they will better understand the history of China and the culture and the traditions .
I think that this will be very helpful to for them to understand the China .
