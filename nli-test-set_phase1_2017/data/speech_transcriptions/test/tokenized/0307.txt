Recommend them to go to the south of my country .
It 's a beautiful place full of interesting things and you can get in touch with uh with very in touch with places forest for examples , uh well well , north of Chile is quite interesting too .
It 's a different culture compared to the south and there are many many interesting museums and I think that the desert in the north is not so interesting than the nature in the south of Chile .
