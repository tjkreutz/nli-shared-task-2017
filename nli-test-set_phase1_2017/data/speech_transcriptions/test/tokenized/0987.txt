The best book I read was uh Micro Economics from Oliver Blosai and um Mr. Elly which is my uh professor for micro economics at uh University of Munich .
This was a very interesting book because um you have to use this book for your lecture otherwise you would n't be able to understand the whole um series and the the economic factors of this lecture and um although it was about five hundred sites and and it was quite easy to read because it gives a lot of examples to make it more clear and not only theory .
