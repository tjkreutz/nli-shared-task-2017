Two years ago a proposal in my uh offered me to send me for to an exchange program .
It was very important for me because uh I found the chance uh to identify new cultures and also the education system there .
It was my first uh abroad trip .
And also uh I found the chance uh to identify the life there .
And uh I I gained additional abilities , also attended some of the clubs there , meet new friends from other countries .
So it was , I think , a very special opportunity for me .
