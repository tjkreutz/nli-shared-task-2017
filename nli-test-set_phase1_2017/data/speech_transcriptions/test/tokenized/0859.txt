Foreign exchange in a big bank .
First , uh to I think to be a trader is a job full of full of excitement .
Once I have had a internship in government stocks , my job was just to do of to be a trader assistant and uh and I find out watching news all over the world and making or losing money in a in a very short time is really exciting .
Second I can I can make a huge amount of money on this job .
When the price of US dollar appreciates , I buy them while I can sell them when the price goes down .
Therefore , I can make money and that 's just sitting in front in front of the computer screen .
So that 's the two reasons why I choose to be a foreign exchange traders as my career .
Thank you .
