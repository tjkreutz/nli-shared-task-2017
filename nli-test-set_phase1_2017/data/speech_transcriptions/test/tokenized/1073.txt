I would like to be an epidemiology because an epidemiology have the opportunity to treat populations instead of to treat individuals or persons .
An epid - and epidemiology study uh the factors that cause a disease .
Through this it have a bigger impact because he ca n't he ca n't study these many factors and also he ca n't uh intervene in these factors and change uh some uh kind of disease .
