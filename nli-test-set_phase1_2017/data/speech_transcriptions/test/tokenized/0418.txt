One of my main hobbies is um playing jazz guitar .

And this opportunity was extremely important uh , it 's quite an important role in a band to be the leader um I got to choose the pieces that we did the uh places where we played um , I got to have final say in the musicians we auditioned and it was definitely a , something which was important and putting on my uh on my resume for applying to different universities uh it kind of proved that I have leadership qualities and that I could organize um people 's work and uh can make my opinions heard and respected .
So it was a special opportunity and important to me .
