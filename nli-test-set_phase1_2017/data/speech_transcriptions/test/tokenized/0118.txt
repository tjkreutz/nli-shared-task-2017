My opinion um a good member of a team has to be a good listener that has too central advantages um first his person will be able to fully understand all um the others members opinions and thoughts and second a good listener in a in a in a team facilitates communication within the team .
Communication within the team being the most important driver of the outcome or output or whatever the team generates that 's why um communication is central and it 's communication can be facilitated very good by good listeners .
