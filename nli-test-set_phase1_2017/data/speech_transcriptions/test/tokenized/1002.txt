What I miss most about my home when I 'm away is my mommy my mom 's cooking , my bed and the I feel , the raw atmosphere when I 'm at home .
I miss my mothers cooking .
It 's not like she 's the best cook in the whole world but there 's just something unique about my mothers cooking that makes me miss it so much when I 'm away on holidays or when I 'm not at home with her .
The other two things that I miss the most are my bed and the in general .
I miss my bed that I can sleep in , that I 'm accustomed to usually and I miss most when I am away .
I also miss the that I can feel at home with my family .
