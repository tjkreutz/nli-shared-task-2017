One of the most most interesting books I have read so far is called Lord of the Flies .
This book is about a plane crash and uh from uh from the plane crash only is student survive and uh they start living on island and there are no uh older people .
And the book explains how wild uh the child children can uh get uh when there are no rules and no uh older people .
In fact uh this book shows how wild people can get uh when they run their , when they live in a uh in an environment where uh there are no laws or no rules are uh executed .
