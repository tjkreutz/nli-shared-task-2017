Um my very great op - opportunity was to be in the Europe for one year .
I was an au pair there and took care of kids , they were four and six and I got very attached with them .
It was a good experience for me .
Um and I found a new friends from different cultures .
They came from Brazil , France , Italy and German too so I um it was pretty amazing to realize um about these cultures and to realize how much I like Germany too , and what to do in my future time , to um I wanna study .
