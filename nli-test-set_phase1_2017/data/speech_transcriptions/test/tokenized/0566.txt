My most important opportunity in my whole life was when I was um an exchange student um because uh this experience gave me uh all the things that I 've known for my second language .
Um I love that experience because they gave me uh uh experience that I have n't experienced before then .
Um that was also important for me because I lived uh alone just for one one year and the I am for that reason I 'm more mature .
