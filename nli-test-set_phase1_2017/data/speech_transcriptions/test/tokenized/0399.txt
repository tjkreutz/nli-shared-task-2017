I think uh an important quality for a member of a team to have and I would be greatly appreciated by the other members of the group is you know how to work with each other I mean know how to work inside that team , that involves many other qualities such as being responsible , having responsibility assuming responsibility for your own acts as they might affect the other team members also being disciplined with whatever you do because discipline is an important quality of a team in its self .
So each member has to have its own discipline and know how to share it with the rest of the group also respect , respect it have very valuable quality .
