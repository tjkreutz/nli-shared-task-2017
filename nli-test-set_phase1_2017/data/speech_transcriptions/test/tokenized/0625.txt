When friends of mine come to my country , I would say that it 's very worth seeing uh town not far away from my place .
It 's very very old town but uh if uh very old houses that are very inter - that are quite interesting to see .
There 's also uh church with the highest tower in the world .
It is seven hundred meters high and you can have a great view of our city when you go out to the town .
