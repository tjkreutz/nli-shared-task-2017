A really special opportunity to me was given by the Rotary International .
I took place in an exchange program three uh six years ago in Mexico .
I lived there for for ten months and uh it was really great for me to learn a different culture , to live in different climate and furthermore I really enjoyed learning a new language which was in fact uh Spanish and uh not English .
Um I really hope that many people will have this opportunity uh to do an exchange here on their own .
For me it was really special .
