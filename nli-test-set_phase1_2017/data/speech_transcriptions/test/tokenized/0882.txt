I think one of the most important things is that I can trust a person um that I can trust the person uh that he or she does the work I told her to do or that that he had that he can trust me that I do the work that he ca n't do .
So I think uh trust is one of the most important things when it comes to team work .
Uh another thing is to delegate things , to know when and who to delegate tasks um when you ca n't do them .
Uh when you ca n't when you have too much to do to do them .
So trust and ability to delegate .
