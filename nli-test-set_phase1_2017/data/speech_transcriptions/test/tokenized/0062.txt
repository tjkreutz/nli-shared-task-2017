Given a opportunity to head the team for the national level uh symposium which was conducted in my college .
I have actually learned a lot of things from this opportunity which I got .
The major uh things what I learned from this opportunity is how to manage a team and how to finish a task within a particular time-frame .
And the most important thing thing that I learned from this opportunity is how to interact with others in a team and get a particular task done in a time-frame .
This has actually helped me in uh in uh various aspects to pursue my job and uh get the task done successfully .
