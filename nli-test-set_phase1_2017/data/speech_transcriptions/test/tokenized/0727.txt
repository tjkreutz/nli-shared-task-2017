When I 'm away from home the thing I do n't I miss the most is my mother .
Uh I really miss her and all the pampering I get from her .
I miss uh and the place where I live I do n't get any good food uh so I really miss all the good food I get at home .
And uh one more thing I miss is all the , you know games I used to play with my siblings and all my friends who used to live around um and uh and I used to , yeah I miss almost everything about the home and everything around .
That 's all .
