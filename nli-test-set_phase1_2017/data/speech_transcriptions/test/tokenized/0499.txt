The opportunity was given to me when I was in the last year of university .
Uh we were given an assignment about um um microwave process .
By the way um I have studied engineering and the process , um the project was hard .
So I needed uh an opportunity to study in a special laboratory but the laboratories are not always available for the use of students .
I asked uh from my from my professor for help and then he gave me the opportunity to work freely in uh in the hours uh that I choose to work in the laboratory .
At the thought of experiments I prepared a very good project .
I even um raw material to prepare a paper from this book .
