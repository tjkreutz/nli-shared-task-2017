Um going to the university is very important thing and uh the it makes me to study very hard in my lessons .
well as you know , the education system in Turkey is very difficult to enter the university that 's why I choose a university in the uh Holland which uh education language is English .
And uh I prepare myself to studying English .
Uh I studying English more than five months and I think my English is enough to understand the conversation between the teacher and the between the people .
So um um I think that 's all I studied at my lessons and I 'm successful in my lessons .
