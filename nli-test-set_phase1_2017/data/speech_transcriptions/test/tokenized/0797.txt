When I went to the United States as foreign exchange student , I miss my family a lot , especially I miss my mom a lot because she always hear my , about what I 'm concerning about right now or everything but I could n't talk to my mom a lot a lot so I miss my mom and uh I also miss Japanese food and I really wanted to have them when I was there and they are the most thing what I missed about .
