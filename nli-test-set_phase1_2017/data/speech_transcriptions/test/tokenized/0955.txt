Think the most special opportunity that was given to me uh is to travel travel to Japan .
Uh two years ago I travel to Japan with the student exchange program and I had the opportunity learn Japanese .
I met with new people , I stayed um with Japanese family .
It really contributed me and I had the best time of my life .
I had the chance to see many places in Japan , to visit different kind of uh museums , to s - to walk in the streets of Tokyo and have make uh friendships with the Japanese people .
It was great .
