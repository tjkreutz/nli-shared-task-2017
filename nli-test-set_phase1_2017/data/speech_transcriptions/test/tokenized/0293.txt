First I have n't thought about any special opportunities I 've been given before but maybe my grandmother gave me the opportunity offered me the opportunity to study at a university that 's a little more expensive and yeah , I have n't have n't accepted that opportunity yet because I have n't started studying yet .
Yeah , and is there anything left to say ?
I ca n't think of any other opportunity right now .
