Well um a special opportunity that I have get in my life was um to to to say the speech of um graduated students in uh when I finished my first degree .
And it was important for me because um I find um this uh thing very important for me and very useful because I explain what I feel about my university and about what the future I can expect for myself and for my colleagues .
And also it was um very great moment because I 'm talking in front of my lecturers and teachers .
