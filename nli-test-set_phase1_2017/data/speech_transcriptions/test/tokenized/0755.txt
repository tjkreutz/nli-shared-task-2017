Quality that I think it 's more valuable on a member of a team is loyalty because I think if a person is loyal you can trust that ember and and that way you can work together as a group and then you can achieve more things together than if you do n't choose the person who is the member of the team and loyalty also speaks uh the way that person perceives not only on team team basis but daily basis as a personnel and a in a personal point of view and as a human being , loyalty I think it 's a very valuable quality that a member should have on my team .
