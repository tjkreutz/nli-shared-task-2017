From another country were going to spend time um in my country , uh I would recommend them to go and visit um two cities .
First of all the city of Cartago which which uh was the the former capital of Costa Rica uh maybe two hundred years ago .
I think it 's uh an impressive city in the historic sense and that 's because you can find a whole variety of of um of traditions and culture and and characteristics of um historic Costa Rica and then also uh the settlements of of um Spaniards .
And then the second city I would recommend would be San Jos√© which is the actual capital of Costa Rica .
