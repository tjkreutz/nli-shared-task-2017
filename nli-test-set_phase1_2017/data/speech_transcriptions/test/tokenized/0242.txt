Although I can take them to , although I can take my friends to a place where uh beautiful scenery uh seen beauty are there in the country , I prefer to take them to the rural areas where the real beauty of the country lays .
And I 'll like them to know about the culture in the society in which our people live .
I also would like our friends to spend some time at our home so that they can know about our living habits which they rarely get to know if even if they visit the place numerous number of times .
So I prefer them to show up because eat and , spend time with my family so that they 'll know what the country is really about .
