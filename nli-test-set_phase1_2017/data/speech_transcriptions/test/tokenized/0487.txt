I would show my friends the city of Hamburg .
It 's the city where I grew up .
Um this city is about one thousand five hundred years old therefore it has a lot of historic buildings and uh a lot of historic about the Second World War in it , so this could be very interesting .
Um the city is not so big , it has about twenty eight thousand habitants but it still has um a lot to offer .
Um some examples , it has uh very good nightlife , so there are a lot of very nice pubs and you can have um a walk through vary nice parks and if there are , the is a river which is very nice .
Yes , that 's it .
