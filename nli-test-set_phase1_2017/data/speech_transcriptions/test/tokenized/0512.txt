Kind of opportunity to be in exchangement during last semester , uh the Fall semester last year .
And I was given the task to be uh mentor those incoming students from foreign countries .
And it was given uh to me just because I was a successful student at my university .
I was one of the best students who applied for the job and there were only six people being selected .
And I was among like I was the first one probably to be selected because none of the other students showed up really great effort as much as me .
And it was it was a great opportunity for me to develop my English in a time .
