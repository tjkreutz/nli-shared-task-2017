Special opportunity for me was to visit Russia .
Russia is a beautiful and uh interesting country .
I was given this opportunity by my school .
In fact uh uh it gave this opportunity only uh to uh ten students of the school .
Russia , I think , is one of the most beautiful country in Europe and uh at least in the world .
Um there are a lot of historical mo - mo - interesting monuments and uh also the culture of the of the country is very interesting .
I tasted uh different type of uh uh foods and uh I appreciate it uh it it very much .
