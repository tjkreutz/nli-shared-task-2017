When I 'm away uh I always miss my cats because uh I think I can not live without them and the reason is that because I do n't have any brothers or sisters so my mum and dad gave me two cats and then I grow up with them so now I communicate with them all the time everyday , in the morning and in after the before the sleeping I always actually I was talking to them so maybe when I 'm away I miss my cat .
