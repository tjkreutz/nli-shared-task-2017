When I was about to make my private pilot license uh for flying large or like airplanes without any engine .
I had to do a lot of work both practically and theoretically , theoretically .
So uh I had to learn all this theories about why airplanes fly , different laws that are important if you use our airspace here in Europe uh how you can communicate with ground and it was important for me because I wanted to achieve the freedom of just being able to fly a plane whenever I want to get up into the air and not being dependent on anything .
