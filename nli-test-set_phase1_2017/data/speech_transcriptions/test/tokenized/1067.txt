So when I 'm away um from my home first what I miss the most is my family because I 'm very very close to my family and I I always lived with them .
And although uh what 's will really miss what I will really miss will be my friends so and all the habits I have I have here in my country and although just just the time itself my country itself so just to be far way to be in another country which is something really different .
So so that 's it .
