opportunity before before f - four years which is to travel to England especially to Cambridge University to have a master .
I had a scholarship for this .
But if this opportunity is important to me because of many reasons .
The first reason , I think it is important that I will have a master without paying money .
Most students all over the world study and pay money for this type of studying but scholarships are not are not .
The second reason , uh after finishing studies , I studying I will work in university which is Brunswick University .
