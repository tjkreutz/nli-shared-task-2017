I am studying European integration studies and I was given the opportunity to take part in the seminar which was dealing with um foreign relations of the European Union .
And the other participants were mostly diplomats and I was there as a student .
And had the opportunity to make many experiences with the daily work of people which are working in the foreign ministries or in the European Commission .
And because the seminar was on Malta it was a very nice time there .
