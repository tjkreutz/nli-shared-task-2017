I lived in China , so if a friend of mine want to visit my country I would choose Beijing to show her around .
First of all Beijing is the capital of China and it 's full of place of interest and second , it is the representative of China .
And for the last reason I lived in Beijing so I 'm more familiar about the things in Beijing like the cars , the streets and the place of interested like the Summer Palace and so on .
So I would like to choose Beijing .
