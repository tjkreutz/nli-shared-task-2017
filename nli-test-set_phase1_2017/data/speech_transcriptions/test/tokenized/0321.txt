I would like to carry my friends to visit uh Guanacaste the north part of Costa Rica and even the Peninsula is in the south part .
Is a very nice place because if they uh well , they like diving , it 's a perfect place for diving to see many kinds of species in the forest .
Um we have a lot of kind of weathers .
Uh for example , um the north part we can go to visit some volcanoes .
Uh the weather is very dry and and there is uh the south part is uh humid weather but it is still .
