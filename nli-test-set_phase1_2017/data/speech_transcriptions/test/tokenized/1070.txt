A valuable member of a team is the quality which in which someone is in which someone is respected I think a team member should respect another 's point of view and he should not be dogmatic in his approach .
This is very important because a team is a group in which each member is allowed to have his own view and if a member is being uh dogmatic the approach will be uh individual - individualistic and the team would not be also so I think the most important quality that a member should respect others point of view and should take into consideration with being dog - dogmatic .
