Opportunity that I was given in my life is my chance to go to the Lithuania as a exchange student two years ago .
It was a very special opportunity because I had the chance I had chances to see a foreign country and a country where former communist country totally different from Turkey and I had the chance to meet people from all around Europe , uh from Norway , from Sweden , England , uh Spain , Italy .
And uh the other chance is I had the opportunity to improve my English .
I I could n't have the chance to speak in Turkish so I had to communicate in English to other uh some students .
