While I 'm away , I miss most about the food in my home because live by outside , we do n't have a lot of chance to eat familiar food .
So when I 'm away I miss the food most , especially my mom 's cooking .
Although there are although there are a lot of choices about schools in big cities other familiar taste is can not be replaced by anything .
