I was a very young girl my mom bought me a horse and I was really happy about that because this gave me the opportunity to learn um to ride and to be in stables every day and to meet a lot of nice friends and so get the ability to speak to people and meet a lot of people .
It also gave me the opportunity to um go to England because as I have learned riding in Germany I could go to England and there teach people riding because English people are not good in riding and Germans are really good in that .
So I had a lot of nice teachers in Germany um with my horse .
I went there and made uh um education where I learned to teach other people .
