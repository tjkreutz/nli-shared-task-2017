One of my favorite book is Mr. Nice .
It is a story of Howard Marks .
It deals with drug trafficking story and explain all the logistic and how we manage to transfer money or drugs or how escaped from the police at the beginning .
I also appreciate more of this book because lots of people went to jail at the end of the book and or we get what they did .
The man concluded by The good is better than the bad and You can you can escape from the police but not every times .
