Great opportunity that I was given uh uh when I was uh fifteen was to participate in mathematics Olympic games .
I think was very important for me because it convinced me uh that uh I really like mathematics and that was what I was going to do later .
And also it was uh a very nice uh mo - uh moment uh when I I met lots of people and many of those are good friends of mine of mine even now .
So it has been important for me both uh from uh uh I would say academical point of view and also from uh social uh relational point of view .
