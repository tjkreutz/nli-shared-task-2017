Uh I come from Italy so I just visit um three main cities .
Rome , Florence and Venice .
Uh Venice is closer to the city where I live but I will start from Rome because Rome is the like the is the capital capital city of the of the country and has the most parts of the Roman 's history all there .
And then Florence is a very nice city because um all the most uh important artist uh uh architects have been there , have lived there .
So there are many um many uh um places that you can visit over there and then .
