In the first year in the university I had some difficulties with some pa- with one of my lectures. It was uh <%> lecture in fact and uh I had some low grades in the first one or two exams. But before the finals I prepared uh myself very carefully and worked very hard. But unfortu- fortunately in the finals two of the finals were on the same day. So I had to work for another topic as well and then I was preparing the critical final exam. But at the end I attempted to do both exams on the same day and I was successful very greatly on both two.
