If I could have any job or career I want, I would definitely want to be a doctor. Being a doctor will make me able to provide help for people and to reduce their pains. Providing helped to people in this manner makes me feel great about myself and what I can provide to my community by taking away people's pains. And at the same time, my efforts in this career will definitely makes me closer to the patients and make me feel great about myself.
