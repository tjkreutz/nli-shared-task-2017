In this year I was given the chance travel my neighboring country Japan cause I was given free tickets to there. It was quite special because I always wanted to uh visit my neighboring country and I had never chance. When I finally got there and see nice buildings and sceneries and uh similar like but different cultures and people in the streets I was amazed and pleased. And there was also special because the trip was with my girlfriend. I was using that opportunity as a celebrating the first anniversary with my girlfriend. When both of us got there we were so pleased and we were happy about the memory.
