Important opportunities that was given to me was an internship to United Nations Development Program. It was important for my studies in economics. Through this opportunity I was able to develop my research skills as well as my writing skills about development development problems of most of the countries in Asia and Africa. Again, uh as a result of this internship I was able to continue with my doctors studies uh and I was able to prepare more papers and present those papers on some professional campus. I also had a chance to meet with some influential people at United Nations.
