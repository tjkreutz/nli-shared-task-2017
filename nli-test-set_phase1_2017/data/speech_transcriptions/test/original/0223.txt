I think the importance for the teamwork is like work together not individual. So for team member they don't need to be so good at. Like example for sports team they don't have to be so good at it but they could help each other and if they could help they can like um they have to have ability to take a chance and do what they have to do. And it's not depend on good or not they have to encourage other team mates.
