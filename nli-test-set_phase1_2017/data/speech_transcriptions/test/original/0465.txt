Well uh I think a quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team is to be respect. Uh I think it's very important it's part of a friendship it's something very important in order to obtain all the respect and all the characters about all the members about all the classmates. So in my view in my own view is very important someone to be respect person from anyone of the team.
