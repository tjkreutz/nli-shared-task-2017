I think for a person to be a valuable member of a team he has um to have the quality of a team worker which means that he has to be able to work with other team members and uh by this he has to respect their opinion, he has to be flexible in dealing with them and uh he has to be responsive to their needs as well as uh given uh his uh input in work. Um I think uh for this person uh to be successful uh he has to um understand other people's weaknesses as well and he has to help his other team members.
