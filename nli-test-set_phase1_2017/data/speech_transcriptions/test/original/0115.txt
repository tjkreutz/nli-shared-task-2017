The things I miss most about my home when I'm away are three different things first I miss my bedroom because it contains a very comfortable and I very much like sleeping in it because it relaxes me very much, the second thing is our garden, we have the garden containing a small pond and several trees that uh provide food in the summer. I very much enjoy lying in this garden and spending my free time there and the third thing is the large amount of food that we have in our refrigerator, this is something I very much enjoy to the time I'm studying at university where I don't have my own food.
