If friends uh come in France to visit me, I think that uh I will begin by a visit of my village because I live in a s- in a village in the South France and so it's a very typical village uh and after, I think that maybe a visit of Paris will <%> will be um suitable because of course it's a symbol of France. There are a lot of museum and theater and uh it's a and very important art places place and um maybe um um a trip near the seas in Mediterranean Sea because um I think that uh our French uh sea is beautiful.
