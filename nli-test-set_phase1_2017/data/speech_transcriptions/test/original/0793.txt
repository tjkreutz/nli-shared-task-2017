Very good quality is somebody has the ability on the one hand to motivate other people and to to make them um do things in a good mood and on the hand to be caring um and looking after others so that on the one hand uh a person tries to stimulate others to do thing things and to to help um achieve the the team goals but on the other hand not um not stepping over others but being caring enough as to see what the individual in the group needs. So I think that's the good quality.
