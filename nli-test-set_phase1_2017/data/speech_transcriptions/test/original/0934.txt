Yeah, last year I had opportunity to go to Toronto General Hospital for one year for surgical fellowship and uh for me I say it was very uh uh important opportunity because I I had the possibility to improve my surgical knowledge and to acquire a lot of uh surgical skills. So, uh moreover uh I had uh also opportunity to visit the city and meet a lot of people living in Toronto. And uh for me it was a very important experience in my life.
