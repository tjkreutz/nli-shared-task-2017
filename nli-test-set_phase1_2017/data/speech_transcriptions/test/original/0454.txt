The thing that I miss most about a home when I was away, it will be my family, my friends uh maybe the food, you know, cooked by my mom or the co- the food provided uh from my home town. Firstly of all, I will say about family. I've been staying with my parents for like about nineteens or like twenty years. Then suddenly I was studying abroad and I will need to leave them leave home and live my live by my own, live independently.
