If I had friends some from some other country I would uh suggest them to visit Didim which is a city nearby the beach nearby the sea. I uh said this because it has uh beautiful beaches and it has historical monuments. They can uh visit the places. And another place that I uh suggest is Istanbul because of its history. Lots of historical monuments and lots of uh place to visit in Istanbul. For example <%> and there is uh <%> of places are uh is vulnerable to see. And another uh p- place that I like them to suggest is for example, Uludag because that is uh can make snowboard and something like that in there.
