The favorite book I read is Harry Potter. I like it very much because it's scientific and it has a lot of magic in the book. All teenage kids will like this book because it has interesting story and it attracts our minds and brains and the book uh the book has a four parts so we have to read all four parts to know what happens in the book. It's scientific and you get a lot of information is gonna like waste your time in a good way instead of watching TV and other stuff like that. I think and advice all kids to read Harry Potter and understand it to like it.
