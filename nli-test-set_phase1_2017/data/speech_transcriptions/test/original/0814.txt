The accomplishments that I required that required me to work very hard was the one that told me that I wasn't able to work very hard enough. This uh accomplishment was very uh serious for me because I knew that it was reality. The accomplishment uh showed me uh the real reality which I knew before but which I didn't want to accept. Therefore in my opinion, telling me the truth also it's isn't the truth I want to have is the biggest accomplishment for me.
