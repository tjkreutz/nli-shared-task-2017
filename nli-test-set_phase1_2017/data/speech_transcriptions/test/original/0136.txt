I remember when I was in school I was given a special opportunity uh to welcome other chief guest of our annual function. The chief guest was the uh chief guest was the uh Minister of <%> uh state of India that time. I had to offer flowers and I had to sing a welcome song for the chief guest. I think that opportunity was very special for me because at that point of time I was representing my whole school in front of him. It was me who was the first one to greet him and it was me who was there to welcome him. It was special.
