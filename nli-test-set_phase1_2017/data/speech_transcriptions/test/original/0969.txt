Someone is coming to my country from foreign country, I recommend Kyoto to visit. First of all it the ancient ancie- ancient capital capital city of Japan so it has many ancient temples and the castles and also some buildings from ancient ancie- ancient time. And also the town is very beautiful. It's kind of traditional Japanese style so foreigner maybe love it. And also because Kyoto is so many so popular place for foreigners, many information can get in English or even other languages. So maybe it will easier for them to travel around. That's why I recommend Kyoto.
