I was given a chance to work at <%>, its a camp in Kuwait that works with children. And um I very much enjoyed my time there because I learned a lot about children and when I grow up I plan to work with children and study education in university. Um they taught me how to take care of kids and play games, and enjoy my time with them instead of always yelling at them. They taught they taught me also new methods. I learned to like always um look out for the children and not yell and scream at them. It showed me responsibility and it give me courage to make strong.
