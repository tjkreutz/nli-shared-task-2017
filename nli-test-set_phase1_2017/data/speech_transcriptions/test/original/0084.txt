I guess the first place I'd suggest would be Kyoto 'cause um all of the sites and uh traditional Japanese cultures and religious um stuff that you could see there. Not to mention the nature outside is so beautiful too. Uh and I think my friends would like souvenirs <%> and stuff and they they like that.
