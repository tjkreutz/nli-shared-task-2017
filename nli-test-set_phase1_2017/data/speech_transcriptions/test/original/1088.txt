I think in a team it is important to have at least one person who can coordinate task and responsibility and thus um help to improve the results because no one is doing some work that another person is doing and he's kind of a boss and overseeing what everyone is doing and coordinating um that everyone is fulfilling his part of the group task and thus maximizing to pay off in the team. And then making everyone giving the best and um helping the team accomplish the best possible result and outcome and um optimizing everything in the teamwork.
