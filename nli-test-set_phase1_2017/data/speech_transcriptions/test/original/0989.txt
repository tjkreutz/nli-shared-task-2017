I read a book book called Glossy Girl, it's uh the first book, there are five towns and uh it's was uh interesting because uh it was about a teenager an uh the world off uh rich teenager and uh the people who are with them and uh it was interesting in my opinion because we can see different people and people who speak about other people and uh I like this sort of book but I like other book either, so it was a good <%>.
