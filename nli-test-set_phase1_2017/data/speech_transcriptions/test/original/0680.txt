This went um in a trip to see um elderly people. I was really amazed to help them, and um be with them for a whole day just trying to feed them, trying to help them, give them some advices and somehow how they can spend time. And um it was really happy and I got a um I just learned a lesson actually that he- that taught me um to help um elderly and how how should I treat my mom when I when she go- become so old. And um it was for me a good opportunity and I I wish that everyone would see these people um so they can learn the same lesson that I did.
