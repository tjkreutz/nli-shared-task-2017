The thing I mis most about my house when I'm gone is mostly my room and my kitchen because I love food in my house and I love my bed who doesn't. And uh especially the people in my country I miss them a lot too because when I'm gone for a while I have no one to hang with when I'm away. And then when I come back it's like seeing all those faces again I haven't seen in a long time and when your back home you just feel safer and better plus it's your home and there is no place like home.
