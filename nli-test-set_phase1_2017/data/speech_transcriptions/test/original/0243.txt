<%> like he said that there will be no other place like home. In fact there are a number of thing things that I miss when I'm away from home of which I would like to point out the most important ones. They are in this specific order. First of all the company of my friends and my comradery that I hang out with um usually with them but I'm away from home. Second, I miss playing out on video games because I don't have access to a tablet anywhere and it's one of the most interesting activities that I like indulge in and thirdly, I miss watching out on television because all I have is my computer and there is nothing else to to watch. Not not even movies that I'm so addicted to watching. So these are some of the things that I definitely miss when I'm away from home.
