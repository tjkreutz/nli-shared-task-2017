Was given to me in my life I will definitely say that uh the opportunity was given to me to go to live and work in Russia, Moscow. I was offered a scholarship in the Spanish Embassy as a <%> in economics. Uh for me it was the first time that I went to live in abroad outside of my home home town. And as as special as Moscow is uh I I can I I think I can say I can manage and I survive. Personally it was amazing experience to live in a spectacular place as Moscow is and uh and professionally for me it was also a discovery as uh I was dealing with matters some important matters of the Embassy. Uh I have a fond memories of my experience in Moscow.
