The book I found mon- most interesting in my school career is the book Sea Doctor from Herman <%> and this book describes the historical background and the emerging of the Buddhism in Northern India before Christ. And I found it very inspiring for my own life. Also and it led me to um have even more interest in Buddhism and joined meditation groups and this is why the this book has the biggest meaning for me among all books.
