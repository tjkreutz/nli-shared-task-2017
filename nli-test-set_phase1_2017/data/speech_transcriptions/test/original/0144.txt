The special opportunity that was given me is was the LDS, the Leadership Development Seminar. It was a international seminar of student around the world. Uh it was special for me because it was a very good opportunity to uh learn culture of other student in the other countries, the way of thinking of each of them. And uh subject itself, su- subject of the seminar or the conference itself was interesting and stimulating for me because it relates to the um many problems of the world and in addition.
