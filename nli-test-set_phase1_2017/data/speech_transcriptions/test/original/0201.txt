I think one of the most important qualities uh that um a team member mus have uh is leadership even though he is not a leader because sometimes when you have to replace him, uh it may be very important to act like a leader. Another thing uh I think is that he have to be very friendly because uh if he doesn't get along with another um members of the team uh uh that everything that they may do uh it will be wrong or uh have a lot of uh mistakes. Uh I also think he must be cooperative uh because uh that's what uh helps the team reach the goal.
