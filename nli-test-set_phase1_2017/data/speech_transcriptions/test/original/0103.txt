Is uh important to see uh and organize everything in the group and and to what is needed and what is to be done by which person. And if you're a well organized person you can arrange everything in order and uh if if you are kind of um messy in your head in your head uh it's not easy to organize the the test that you have to do in the uh in the team. Uh as well being a being a helpful helpful person is something that that helps you to be a good good member I think.
