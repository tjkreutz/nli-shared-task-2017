Special opportunity that was given to me is being the secretary of my college magazine which comes out annually. This opportunity was special and important to me because I learned many new things from this. One thing that came out was how to work as a team, uh being a team player and also leading the team sometimes. There were many uh arguments or disagreements but then you always have to come out with the positive output. But one thing, one more thing that came out was how to ask for sponsorships and to convince people to aid your magazine. That require confidence. Uh for me, I have to communicate with people also.
