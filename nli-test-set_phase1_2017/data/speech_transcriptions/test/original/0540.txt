That makes someone a valuable valuable member of a team is uh team he must be able to work efficiently in a team. He must be able to help the other members of this team very well. The one reason why I think team work is one of the important quality for a member to be a in a team or group to have is because it's simply because it is a team it all depends on team work. The success and the failure of the project that the team is working on depends on how good the team is, how good the work they help out each other and if that one member is a <%> team he he must be able to hold on to all the members and uh and give his valuable output to others so i think that team work is one important quality that a member should have.
