I've been living in a hostel for the past four years, that's why I miss my home a lot. The the things which I miss a lot are first of all the good food. After living in the hostel and eating the food for four years I have come to know that the ho- food which is served at home is always the best. Secondly I always miss the comfort which is available at home, for example when I'm depressed my parents and my elder brother and sister are able to comfort me but there is no one here in the hostel to comfort me. Thirdly I also miss the love affection which which the which the parents give to me. So I miss all all the <%> all the about things like food comfort and love uh which are not available in our hostels. Other thing which I miss are that uh uh like.
