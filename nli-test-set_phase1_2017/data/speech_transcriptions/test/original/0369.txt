The thing that I miss more with my home when I'm away from home is my family and relatives. I miss my mother a lot because she takes care of me very well and when I'm away from home I have to take care of all my things on my own. She cooks great food for me and when I'm away I have to cook on my own or go out to eat which is really don't prefer. So when I'm away from home, I miss the things that she, my mother does for me. She takes care of takes care of me very well when I'm not well, when I'm when I'm sick she takes very good care of me and also she prepares good food for me and the love that my family gives and the relatives gives. That is what I miss most when I'm away from home.
