Opportunity the one I took it it was like hard to me but hopefully when I did it, it was so important to me to understand or to think in this life and to imagine nice thing and to learn a new things in my life. Uh the opportunity was about uh how to take care about something. When I take care about something and have the responsible about it it's uh kind of hard in the first time but he will, like it will be easier for you in the second and third time. When you practice the thing it will be easier for you than, than the first time. So everybody has to practice.
