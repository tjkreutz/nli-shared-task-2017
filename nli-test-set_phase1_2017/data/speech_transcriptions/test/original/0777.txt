You know I live in Munich. It's very popular city in Germany. So I would invite my friends to join me to some cultural events we have in Munich. The most special event is so called Oktoberfest. It is a big event in the autumn in Germany. There is also a big river in Munich and a lot of museums which are very interesting. I by myself prefer the Old Cultural Museum. It is located in the middle of the city. I often be there and just enjoys the culture and study some of these arts and after this I would go out for coffee in some nice coffee shops.
