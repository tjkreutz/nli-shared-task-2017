Well actually everybody who is home and uh actually I really miss my uh my mom's food and everything she makes at home. I miss my brother, and going out with my friends and uh seeing our teacher because I've already graduated. And I love being at home, I love my we- the weather here in Dubai like going to the beach, it's sandy here and stuff and well I like it. I'd rather stay in my home country than going outside but if it was important to go out maybe for a study or something that's better.
