Uh if some friends come from another country in uh here in Switzerland, I think I would probably show them Geneva. Go to see the <%> and the lake, because its a great part of Geneva. It's a calm place. Um it's really beautiful to see it when there's sun. Um maybe take them to go shopping and probably get and I was able take them to the United Nations to show them where the United Nations are and uh and I think it's important to show that Geneva offers a great chance of uh international relation. Um probably I would go to a trip to <%> or maybe to the <%> to go to the <%> Park to get sun with them.
