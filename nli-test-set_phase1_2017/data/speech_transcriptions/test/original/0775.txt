For me, a quality that I think uh someone a valuable member of a team is a someone who has the leadership. Uh first reason, someone who has a who has a leader sh- ship. He can't uh can uh help the others in their co- co- and with the others and um e- if you have uh we ha- we don't have someone of who has leadership and our group can can uh fail. For these two reason, I think I think it's important to get uh a leadership to make someone to a very good member in our group.
