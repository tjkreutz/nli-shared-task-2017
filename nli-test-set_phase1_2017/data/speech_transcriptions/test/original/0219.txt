I think one of the most important quality of a member of a team must have his to be a team player. It's important to uh know well all the team mates and not to consider uh oneself as the only member of the team uh one it's that's what makes it difference between a team and a team sport and individual sport. Being able to play with others and to cooperate um the the player must have must have the capacity to uh share his energy with others and to uh and to adapt to others um players um.
