Um a very special opportunity that was given to me was in um well during my third year of high school uh when I won a scholarship to go to the US for a whole year and study there as a foreign exchange student in high school. And this this uh experience this opportunity really gave me a lot because um it enabled me to um learn about a different culture from mine and also to be away from home for such long time. It made me grow and uh it widened my horizons in a way that I really appreciated uh school system in the US.
