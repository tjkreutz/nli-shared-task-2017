If I could have any job or career, I choose a job as a good software engineer at multinational company. Today, the world's most income comes from the software companies. At present, the software companies are ruling and changing the dollar rate all over the world. Moreover, a software engineer gets a great salary than any other employer in any other field. My dream is to get a job in a Microsoft company as Microsoft company is one of the world's biggest software companies present in the world. The moreover the companies look after the the their employees very well. They give them a good salaries as well as they have a good parties at the uh the weekends. And so the employees enjoy themselves very uh themselves very beau- uh very beautifully in their companies. So I prefer job as software engineer.
