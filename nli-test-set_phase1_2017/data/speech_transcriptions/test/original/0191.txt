Well, to be frank with you, I do enjoy my present job as a science teacher in high school. However if I can switch off my life and get a job or career I want and maybe I'll try to be a professor in the institution for one thing. I do really enjoy the education and teaching process so I like to stay in the field of education, in the academic atmosphere. And in addition, to be a professor would guarantee me and enable me to concentrate on a subject that I'm interested in and I can have further study in art and uh maybe I can work on some work on some projects and I can go more branch and I can be privileged to do many things that which cannot be done if I am simply a teacher.
