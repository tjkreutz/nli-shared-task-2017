Well the thing that I miss most at home is uh food. I mean uh the food anywhere it can be delicious, you can have different types of cuisines but the food at home is different because I mean you get used to it, you know your <%> get u- get used to it and my mom, I mean I love the way she makes food, it's so delicious. I love the <%> she makes, I love the <%> she makes and I mean this is one thing which you can get different types of things that are different when at home but the same thing cannot be got. And other thing that I miss about home is my uh siblings, I mean I'm very close to them and I love spending time with them. In conclusion I would say that food is one thing which I really relish about home and I really miss.
