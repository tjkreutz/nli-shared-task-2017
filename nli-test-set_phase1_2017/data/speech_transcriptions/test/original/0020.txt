If some friends from another country would come to visit me and I I would definitely take them to Istanbul which is a big metro uh located on the north of east of the Turkey Ruplic and actually it's a modern city with so many historical places and with uh so many mosques and such and actually, I think they would really like the area for for because it's <%> place uh uh uh and because it's a metropole, I think they will like the place and they will get used to to the place easily because they're from uh my friends are from Europe for example.
