It's a very long and narrow country. I would recommend to visit both the south and the north. The south uh north because of the desert and the south because of the glaciers. Those are the most beautiful landscapes of my country and are as well uh the most dominated by wild nature, um uh with less people in them. And they are also characteristic uh or or show the main characteristic of my country which is the diversity um of of the nature and landscapes and um and climate.
