In two thousand and five I decide to prepare uh travel to Brazil during the summer and uh it was uh self prepared journey throughout a big area of Brazil uh only with uh um carrying uh means of transport. It was very important for me because I would like to to know well this country and uh it was very difficult because the infrastructure there is like poor so the preparation is that was very difficult but the journey was a success.
