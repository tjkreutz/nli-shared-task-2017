The city I suggest that would be Beijing because first uh as you know China has a very long history and is the capital city of China. Uh Beijing is the center of culture of China. So you can see, you can go to the museums to um uh to get the knowledge about the Ch- uh culture of Beijing of China. And secondly uh we uh uh Beijing has no uh have very uh have a lot of uh available sightseeing uh for for example as for being a city the Great Wall and so long. And finally if the if my friends were come were coming in Beijing at two thousand and eight, it will be a good chance to join the Olympic game that will be hold in Beijing.
