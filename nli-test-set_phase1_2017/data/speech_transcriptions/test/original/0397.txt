The special opportunities that gave to me while I was in the third years in my university. I have this opportunity to go to a lab in my department and had do some research work. Um it is very important for me for two reasons. First is that I can review and practice some knowledge I have learned before from my text book and have deep impression. Also I I can meet some new people and got some new relationships in my university. And uh learn something new from my professor and research advisor. So it is important to me.
