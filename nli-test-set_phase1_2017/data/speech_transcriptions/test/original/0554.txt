If my friend from out of <%> were going to spend time to invite me and I would suggest they uh actually the Taipei City and there two reasons why. I think the Taipei City is the perfect place to go. Our first reason is that because Taipei City has a lot of restaurants and for example uh I can ta- pick pick them up them and and take them to a very uh a variety kind of uh restaurant, eat a different kind of food. And the second is that because Taipei City a lot of a lot of department store and that we can uh for example, we can go there uh for a long day and whole day to buy things and to look and to look around for some reason that I just mentioned. So I think.
