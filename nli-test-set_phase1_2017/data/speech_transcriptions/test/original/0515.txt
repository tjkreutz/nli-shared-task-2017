Place in Italy that I would strongly suggest someone to visit is Amalfitan Coast uh for um in particular for two main reasons. In particular the weather is great, sunny. The sea is beautiful and the people, the other reasons, people are amazing. Uh differently they like to um to um to to to give everything they can to tourists to show <%> surround around. And the also the food is is uh very good, it's also based on seafood and the lemon, a typical product is the lemon- Limoncello is very good in uh in that uh area, landscape, sea and mountain in just one piece of land. Uh I would strongly suggest to go.
