Uh I would advise my um visitors from another country to go visit the north part of Chile because uh it will provide them with a different what they've seen especially they come from Europe where the all my friends come from and they have a uh much similar weather than uh the weather we have themselves in Chile. So I think he northern would be northern parts of Chile would be a much more interesting uh s- site to to see for them. I would suggest them to go to value of the moon, <%> at Atacama to see the desert of Atacama for example.
