Have any job or career I wanted I would choose the Indian police <%> because they have the name and standards in the society. They have high standards in the society and they get to do the adventures and this feels very good and challenging and you get to do adventures on accounts to prove what you are and what're made of. You'll be respected in the society for fighting against the evil, the crooks or ad or even the illegal activities and you have each and every moment of the illegal things going on and you can catch them and prove your to the society and you're doing something good to the society. So I would definitely go into the police department.
