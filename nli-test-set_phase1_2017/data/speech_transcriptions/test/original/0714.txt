Very special opportunity that was given to me was uh when I got elected class president because uh I had a lot of responsibility. Uh I got elected the class president in uh tenth grade and eleventh grade and uh I think I had so much to do uh dealing with uh the class. I really had to show my compassion, my compassion and also my ingenuity uh in order to successfully uh defend the class during uh the end of the terms and uh I think uh I never let the class down. And uh it was a very opportunity to show the teachers and other class of what I was capable of doing.
