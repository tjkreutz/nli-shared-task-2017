There are several things I miss while I'm away from home. Uh the most primary of this is the security which is provided by my parents and my friends while I'm at home. Uh the security refers to things which are not really uh which are not really concerned about and basic frame of my mind. Uh then the second thing is the love of my parents, my brother, as well as the friends which I normally while I'm at home. Then there is the fa- uh the family surroundings which are around around me while I'm at home. These family surroundings refer to my to my room, my books, my computers, etcetera. Uh I've been away from home most oc- on many occasions and these three are the primary things I feel I miss the most. Thank you.
