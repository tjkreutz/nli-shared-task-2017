The greatest opportunity that I had in my life was when when I get my visa to come to America. Uh I've never been in that country before so it was very exciting for me. Plus I always um wanted to come here to learn the culture, see their lifestyle, how different it is as of my my home lifestyle. And learn about the English <%> it's very important life in the world wide. Uh when I came here I could uh exchange with them my cultures, I could make uh many friends and even I have the opportunity to share my cultures, my food with them.
