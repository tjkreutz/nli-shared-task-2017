If uh friends from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest him to spend time in Seoul because it's the most developed city in my country Korea and it's the most comfortable place to live. Also I could introduce him my friends I could introduce my friends to him. Last year a a Japanese boy came and he became my friends and couldn't find new people around there so I could introduce him to my friends and they could be friends too. Now we are pen-pals. And for these two reasons I think if a friend came from another country if he was going to spend time in my country, I am going to suggest all of them.
