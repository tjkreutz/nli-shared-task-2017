When I'm away from home I really  miss my mom, sister and my dad, the food that mom makes for us, uh the general familiarity of the surroundings, the ease at which my house puts me in. It's the general feeling of wellbeing, you know, the fact that I could do anything that home. Plays around, relax nobody would tell me anything. No formality as such, I miss all that uh when I'm away from home. Uh I miss the comfort, the secureness, uh the security my home offers me. The comfort level. Uh everything about it. I mean home is home, I have to miss it.
