A person should have a good leadership to be a to be a va- valuable member of a team, because when a team is lots and do don't doesn't know what to do then that person should leave the team and the other team members to do this and that stuff. And when they have a problem let's say they um two two team members have a fight between them then then then they'll need a leader the person who has leadership can fix the problem and talk it over so the the the leader can actually uh make the team more safe.
