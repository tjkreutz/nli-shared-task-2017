The most thing I uh remember if I went away my home my home it would be my family and relatives because they because they share with me and uh they have shared their joy and happiness and sadness also and uh every every most of the person miss their family when they go away so it's natural for me to miss miss them. Uh and when when you go there is no parents or someone you can talk to you can talk is to like your parents or your family or your relatives.
