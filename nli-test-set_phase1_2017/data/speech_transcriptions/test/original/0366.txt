A very important quality for a team member is in my opinion a fair player. I think uh as I myself play soccer in team uh it is the most valuable value at all to be fair at all to not to play a false game and then always admit your own mistakes and especially your own uh faults and uh secondly which is pretty important for me is to be reliable. This means players should always attend practices as well as games. If somebody is not reliable at all and uh he doesn't attend any games, it's not a real team you you'll be proud of.
