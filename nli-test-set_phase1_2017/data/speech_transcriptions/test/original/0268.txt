I've got quite a lot of experience with homesickness uh for I've been traveling quite a lot. Um for instance, I visited Australia in two thousand and one and uh two thousand and two uh and I stayed there for a whole year and I met with a lot travelers from various countries and of course among uh homesickness was um was the main topic. Um many of them cried at night. Uh and of course, it's hard to be away from uh from the people you love, from your family, from your friends for for amount of time.
