I would choose to be a National Geographic photographer. This would require me to travel the world and meet new people. I would really love to take pictures of nature, landscape, animals and other stuff. Uh meeting new people will make my career will expand my career and allow me to learn new languages and travel the world and to see all the wonders of the worl- that the world has.
