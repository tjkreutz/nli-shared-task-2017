Special opportunity that was given to me was a project manager in my company. And the opportunity was very important to me because for two reasons. One, it was the first opportunity given to me as a team leader to prove my talent and skill. The second reason, it would develop confidence in me to speak in a group. And mainly the special opportunity inspired me a lot.
