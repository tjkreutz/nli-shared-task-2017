If a friend of mine come to the city where I live, I will show you the first uh uh great uh re- uh bridge across the Yangtze River. This bridge is of great significance in our city because you know our city is very special. It's divided into two parts divided by the Yangtze River. Uh before the establishment of this bridge, uh there is great difficulty in communication between the two parts but after years once being set up uh our life has greatly been changed, more information and communication occur. So if I have a chance to show you around the town, I'll first lead him to the first ri- bridge across the Yangtze River.
