The important quality which I think uh of a is required to to be a good uh group player or a team player is uh cooperation. I think it is important because if you are ready to help others and in turn get ready to get help from others that will improve the chances of a success of a team because in the team you are there to work, currently learn from others and uh tell others what to do and how to do. Basically it's a team work and if there is no cooperation between the team and understanding the team cannot success so that's why I think that is very important.
