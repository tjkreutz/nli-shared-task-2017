About opportunity that was given to me at Howard University as an internship this summer. I was selected uh to a research project by Howard faculty and uh why I am talking about this opportunity is that uh I met several professors from my backgrounds, from my <%> engineering and I had the chance to see uh how research was carried on Howard University. And I ha- I also had a chance to see how research is practiced, how people are encouraged to do something new and better. And this uh opportunity changed many things in my life so I think this uh this a very special opportunity and uh uh the best opportunity I've ever had.
