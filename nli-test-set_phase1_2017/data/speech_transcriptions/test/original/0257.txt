Last year I wanted to go to Spain. This is why I had to work very hard. I uh went in hospital, there the searches uh for some secretary and um I went there and uh I got the job. Uh I wanted to  go to Spain as such um and the south of Spain I'd go there every year and it's very very important to me because my aunt have a house there and um I like to be there and there I can relax. I can visit some friends there and that is why um it is so important to me, was it so important to me to go there last year.
