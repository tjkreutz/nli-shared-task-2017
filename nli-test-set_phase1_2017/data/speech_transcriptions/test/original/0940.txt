I live in Paris in France and if a friend of mine coming from another country would come and visit France I would suggest him first to visit Paris because there are some beautiful monuments that are to be seen in Paris. For example the the Eiffel Tower or the <%> and the Champs Elysée's avenue that uh because these are the most uh landmark of France but uh I wish also to get him to see uh all the places like <%> is a place where I go Skiing because I think it's a wonderful place to make ski. Uh you can go off this very easily.
