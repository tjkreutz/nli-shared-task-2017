Well I'm gonna talk about uh  Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen uh that I read a couple of days ago. Uh I thought the book was interesting because it presents a gothic parody um of the author in Ann Radcliffe. Uh this parody, actual parody um and it also shows and enhances um uh high sense of irony, um ironical descriptions that are enhanced uh once again uh people behaviors at that time. So of course I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen.
