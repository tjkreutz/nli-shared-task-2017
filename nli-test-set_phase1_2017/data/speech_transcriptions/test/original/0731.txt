One interesting book which I have ever read would be uh One Night at Call Center which is uh written by Chetan Bhagat. And uh it talks about uh six people who are working in a call center and how are they not happy with their lives and they have to work in the call center because of very different reasons. And I like that book because the vocabulary is easy, it's simple, it's nice an uh the end was very, I mean the end was very different. And also I like about this book is the writer, that is Chetan Bhagat, he's an engineer himself and uh he he goes to the, I mean he tells how it feels and how those people work in the in a call center.
