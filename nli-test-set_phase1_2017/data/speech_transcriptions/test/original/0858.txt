Person is um adaptability for uh team member a member of a team. Adaptability in my point of view is important because uh in within a team there are different ideas coming up, there is a group working together, everybody has different ideas and um often like your ideas do not get picked or like your the the idea you have at the beginning of discussing a topic might change during the, might change during the discussion you have with the group. So this means that the good group member should be able to adapt to shift his um, his point of view, his uh what he thinks has to be done so that the the group can or all the the entire group can receive the best uh result.
