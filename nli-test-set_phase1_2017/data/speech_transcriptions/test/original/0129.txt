When I'm away the most something that I miss about um home is the comfort I have from at my house. I can if I'm hungry or if I'm thirsty I just go to the fridge and take something out. Um I have some very comfortable uh sofas and armchairs where I can lay in and try and watch TV with all kinds um of channels, we have about one hundred different channels uh to which I can use. Then I also I miss my Hi-Fi device my my um Hi-Fi device and uh I also miss um the food my mother cooks for me and uh I miss my girlfriend of course most please.
