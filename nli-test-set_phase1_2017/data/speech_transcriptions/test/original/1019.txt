The last really interesting book I read was a book Speak. It's about a girl who goes to the school where everybody hates her because she called the cops for a party. I really like the book because it's interesting that she doesn't want to speak about what happed and at the end it all comes out and she can't speak up. That's why the book is called Speak because the girl first doesn't speak it all, refuses to talk and doesn't resist and doesn't fight against the other following students who want to make her hard but at the end, she can speak up and this is why I really like the book. It was the best book I read this year so far.
