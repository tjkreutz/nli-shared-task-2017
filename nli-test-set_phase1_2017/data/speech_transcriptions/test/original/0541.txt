Go to uh central Mexico in my case because this is the places we can find too many customs and traditions <%> because under northern Mexico, we have all uh uh influence from the Americans so we, I don't I never suggest to go to the north. Example from my suggestion is because I have been in southern Mexico and central Mexico and I have a great experience to different cultures and even I didn't know about my uh country so I prefer to go to the central so I could experience that I had and about uh ask for tourist uh an alternatives is going to be a to act more entertainment to this.
