When I'm away from home I probably miss the most my parents and my friends. My parents for the following reasons. Uh first of all I like to have a lot of discussions about politics with my dad and of course uh I like the food that my mom prepares whenever I'm home so that's probably the reason why I miss my parents. And I also miss a lot of my friends when I'm away from home. Um I'm normally away from a lot because I play a lot tennis tournaments and so I don't have a lot of chances to see my friends. So whenever I'm home I try to use this opportunity to play games with them, to talk about the latest news with them and just to meet them for it's own sake.
