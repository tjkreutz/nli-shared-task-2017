I got a good opportunity when I go go for interview. Wh- wh- when I was selected in the interview the interviewers ask given me an opportunity for going going for the job or going for an upper studies in the in the job itself. The opportunity give me to study more about the subject I'm I'm I had been studied. I gone for the upper studies because I'm more int- interested to learn about my my subject. And after the after the studies I got a much better job which I was looking for. So this opportunity was precious for me and so special.
