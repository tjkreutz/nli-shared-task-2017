Well uh if I had friends from uh different, it depends what uh what place they come from. So if they came from a developed country a developed country like Europe, I probably show them uh places like Toron- I show them places in Toronto I show them places such as the CN Tower, the sky dome, the uh um Rogers Centre so that they could see that you know what I mean how Canadian lifestyle is and how different it is to their lifestyle. If I had a family or friend member for a uh undeveloped country such as Africa I'll show them uh the difference that our lifestyle is towards theirs so maybe show the a basketball match something that they've never seen or never experienced so that I mean they can enjoy this day while their over here in Canada.
