The best opportunity that or at least the most important opportunity that I have recently gotten was being able to go to do my professional practices at the Embassy of Mexico in Finland. The reason why I think that this was a really important opportunity was that I was able to see another country, I was able to know another cu- another culture and I got to meet a lot of really important people either ambassadors or also people from the Ministry of Finland and that showed me how many different kind of relationships we have.
