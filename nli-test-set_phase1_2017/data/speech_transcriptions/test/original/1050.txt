In my opinion, uh one of that good quality should a member of a team should have is patience, for many reasons. First reason is, uh if you be patient, you can think more useful of your team because some people they cannot make any decision when they are like im- impatient or they are angry or something like that. Second thing is, uh when you you have this kind of a quality, everyone can uh like you, he can speak with you about his problems and solve uh problems.
