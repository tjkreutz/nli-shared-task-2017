A special opportunity that was given to me was to represent my country at I triple E international week which was held in the ER two thousand five. One forty five representatives from different countries have come there. There we discussed problems faced by engineers worldwide. It was important opportunity because at a very young age I was able to give my input for a global cause. All in all, it was a very good experience to know different people from different countries and a lifetime opportunity which I can.
