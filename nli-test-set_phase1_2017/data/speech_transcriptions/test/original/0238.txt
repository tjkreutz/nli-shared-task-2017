The special oppor- opportunity was given to me by my parents when I completed my schooling, it was uh to go uh for higher studies for the engineering or to how I get a commerce degree. This uh opportunity was very important for me because uh as a dream uh as a child I uh I had always dreamed uh to become an engineer to uh acquire my uh uh career in technical field. Also uh this opportunity give me a a chance to prove my proof and earn a better earning than being a a commerce graduate. Uh so it's very important.
