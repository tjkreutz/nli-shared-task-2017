Uh to attend uh to class at school. And uh it was really important to me because I think extracurricular activities especially at school are really important to open your mind. I was able in this class, in this drama class to express myself and to discover uh dramatic offers from all round the world and uh it was very enriching for myself. And uh it's important because it is it gave me uh self confidence that uh I didn't have before and um I really appreciate it this point and I admire a lot this teacher.
