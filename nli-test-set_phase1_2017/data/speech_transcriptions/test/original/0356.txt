I was given an opportunity as a tour as national social service member. This is the most important opportunity in my life that I have got that give me the exposure to the society, that one also makes me to help other people, those who suffer. This the great opportunity that gets every student in his life. This national social service scheme is given by the central government of a country. This helps the every student to exposure to society and also to know the things that happens around us. This the great opportunity for me.
