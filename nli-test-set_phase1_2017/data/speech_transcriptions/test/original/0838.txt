Often many things that I miss when I'm away from home the most important of it is my parents. They are a source of inspiration and reach to me even during my downtimes. Hence in their absence, I feel a bit lonely. The second most important thing that I miss away from home is the food. My mum is an excellent cook and the food that she makes is the best according to me. Hence when away from home I miss it a lot. Eating junk food really is not soothing and home food according to me is the best. Apart from this my room is another treasured area which I miss. The room is a place where I hide my belongings and it makes me feel really at home. And hence once away I miss my room as well.
