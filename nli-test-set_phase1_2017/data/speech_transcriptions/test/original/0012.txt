Although I've been living in Berlin or three years my home actually reminds been in the small village where I was born. And uh well the thing I miss most about this is my parents and my old friends because I actually do have a lot of friends here in Berlin but um none of this as a friend um with whom I have spent much time as with as with my old friends. We were at school together um some even uh share uh share the same kindergarten with me and all this this wonderful time we um spend together is something I really miss a lot and uh every time I um see them again and I feel like this is a friendship of another quality as the others I have here.
