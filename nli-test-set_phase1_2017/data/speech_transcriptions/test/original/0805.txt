Well um I live in Saudi Arabia and the city that I recommend my friend to visit is uh Al-Khobar. It's uh it's not a big city, it's a small city in the western, eastern area from Saudi Arabia. Uh uh it has a a wonderful beach and it als- it also has a variety of uh places and sightseeing. Uh also I recommend it because uh uh the crowd it's uh since it's a small city it's not it will not be very crowded. Uh so our so Al-Khobar is a good place.
