I would like to be an epidemiology because an epidemiology have the opportunity to treat populations instead of to treat individuals or persons. An epid- and epidemiology study uh the factors that cause a disease. Through this it have a bigger impact because he can't he can't study these many factors and also he can't uh intervene in these factors and change uh some uh kind of disease.
