If a friend from another country were going to spend time in my country, I'd like to uh take him to Naples uh because of three reasons. First, because of food. In fact Naples is famous for pizza. And uh I'd like uh him and I'd like him to taste this food. Secondly, because Naples is a a beautiful place and the beaut- beautiful town and I want him to see uh the islands that uh are close to Naples. Finally, uh I like uh peoples who lives in Naples because they are very friendly.
