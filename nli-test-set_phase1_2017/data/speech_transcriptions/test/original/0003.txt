The quality that I think is uh very valuable if you are a member of a team is um if you have the ability to share because you're working in a team so um and not on your own so if you're able to share the right information everyone  of the team can benefit from that not only yourself so you have to share. Um another reliable or not reliable but valuable trade would be to be reliable, because if you're reliable then the whole team um feels more secure because they know things will happen on time and the right things will happen because you are prepared and they can rely.
