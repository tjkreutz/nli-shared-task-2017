I would suggest my friend to visit Kyoto. This is is be- because there are many places to visit in Kyoto. Kyoto is an ancient city. It has many temples, many old buildings which from visiting the places you learn much about Japanese history. There also places where you can experience many things. For example traditional way of weaving, painting, etcetera. And also there are many interesting people in Kyoto. Since there are many universities, highly motivated students are come from all over the world.
