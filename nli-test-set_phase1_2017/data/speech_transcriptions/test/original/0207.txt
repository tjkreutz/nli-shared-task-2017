Well, uh when I was a junior I went for the vice president of the student party in my university. Um because the competition is so fierce, that I was very great that uh I have got the opportunity. We had a small uh campaign team actually and we canvas the student for vote by putting up the posters, uh giving out the brochures, etcetera. And at the last night I gave a three minute um campaign speech in front of more than two thousand people. And at last I won by a fair by only ten votes. So um it was really my day. And it is really the most important opportunity that I was ever being given.
