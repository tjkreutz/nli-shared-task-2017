Special opportunity that I was given was to represent my team as a team leader in the current company that I work in and carry out a presentation in front of a client. This opportunity was very important for me since uh it would rate me as a a prospective leader of my company in my company and would definitely allow me uh to enter a wide uh role and give me an opportunity to work on different kinds of projects uh better projects, bigger projects than what I'm working on right now. And it it was an important opportunity for me to uh display the skills that I have which uh I had not displayed in uh my work work culture a- as long as my working profession was there. So definitely it was a a very special and good opportunity for me.
