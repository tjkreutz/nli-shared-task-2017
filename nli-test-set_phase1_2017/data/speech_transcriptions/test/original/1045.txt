Uh what I miss a lot or miss the most when I leave my home is the food that's made by my mom. Uh because no doubt anybody can go like good from anywhere in any restaurant and anything else, but uh the main thing like the main uh th- the love that's being pleased by mom and dad uh food is the most important thing that I miss. Even though that they know that I've got the food from various places I live in or in the restaurants, but the most nutritious part uh is the bean that made by my mom and it's the mainly thing I missed a lot and uh it is no doubt resulting the duration of my health, as well I'm um being relying on the fast foods all the time. So uh I think food is the most important thing that I'm missing a lot when uh I left them.
