Going to spend time in my country I would suggest for him to go to Heidelberg because it's a very old fashioned city. It has a lot of architecture and it's popular for the big military bases. Also it's a very cultural place with a lot of different people. So it can be considered as a <%> park. For me Heidelberg represents a German city uh a real German city because it has a lot of features like I mentioned the architecture, like museums and it's always nice.
