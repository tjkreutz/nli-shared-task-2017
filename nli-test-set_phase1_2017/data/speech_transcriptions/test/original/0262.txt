December I was given the oppr- opportunity to make my internship in a hotel in Paris. And basically I could rest on uh my my uh where where I was working so I had an apartment in the hotel. There was a special opportunity for me because um it was easier than having an internship where I wou- I I had to travel everyday to the place where I was I would have to work. Um I think that such opportunities need to be taken every time you have them um and that's why I did. This experience of my internship was very important for me.
