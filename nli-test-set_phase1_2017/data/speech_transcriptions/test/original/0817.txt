The thing which I miss most about home when I am way is my mom. My mom makes food for me and the love which she gives me is indispensable. When I am away from home, I miss my mom's handmade food and the love which she gives me after after my office hours. The thing which I miss one one more thing which I miss when I'm away from home is the thing which makes me sleep so well and that's her love. My mom makes me sleep and her lap which makes me go stress free and I feel I have entered into the heavens. This way I suppose I'm the most most missing thing when I'm away is my mom.
