If my friends uh from another country were going to spend time ion my country, I would suggest him to visit my city <> in the south east. It's a big city. It's a typical city from Spain. You also have uh good food. You can go to see uh ancient buildings like uh museums or uh you also have a good universities and is uh like like I said, it is a cold city so you can visit the the several beaches that we have there to uh spend time. We have good climate, good food so it's  a wonderful city to have visit.
