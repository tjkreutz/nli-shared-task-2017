Um the interesting book I have read is My Friend My Love from <%> and uh I think it was first a great book because uh it's a book of how we syntactical to wait when you are are tired because it's not very important topic, it's just to be cool. Moreover and it's a friends and love history. So you have no to to be very concentrated on the book. So it's quite cool.
