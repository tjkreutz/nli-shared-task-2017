In university one of the last courses I had to attend um was about a company. In particular we had to study UPS which is the United Parcel Service and we had to describe deeply the process that hey had and the things that they did. Um for example uh the packages, the process of taking the packages and uh delivering it to the customers. For in a group of six people and it has been really hard to work with the other people and have all the same ideas and try to do the work properly. So I think that this was a really um hard work we had to take on but at the end everything worked out fine. So I'm very happy with the grades we got on the project.
