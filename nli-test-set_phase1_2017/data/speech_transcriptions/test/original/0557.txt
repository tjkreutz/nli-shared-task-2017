If I can any job or career, I would choose to become the chief executive officer or CEO for for mainly two reasons. First, uh I can earn a lot of money and to to help poor people. The famous CEOs like the Bill Gates can usually earn a tremendous amount of money and they spend they spend usually spend it for <%>. Also, I can lead many officers and workers uh when if I become the CEO. Uh I'm sure of myself that I can lead many people well because I was the president of my school and many school recognize me as a good leader. So I think that the the most adequate career is the CEO for me.
