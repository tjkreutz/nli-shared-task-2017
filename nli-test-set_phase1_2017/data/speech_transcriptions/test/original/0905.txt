I like to be a traveler as you <%> choose. You know, traveler can travel to many different places. As for me, I like to travel to Xingzhou. I've heard of it from my uh I've heard it from my friend that Xingzhou has a great station mountain and there is a lake between it. The friends tell me that and just relax in the water lake and the sky will still blue to uh adjusting over your head. I can imagine how romantic it is and also, I want to travel to uh the Great Wall. You know, the Great Wall is the pride of joy of China and I've haven't gone there, I haven't got a chance to get there. So I could really want to travel there and also become a traveler means travel to Shanghai where there is a lot of underground there. I mean, that would take less I have had a choice.
