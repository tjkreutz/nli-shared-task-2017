The most important quality a team member needs to have uh to be a real team player is the ability um to listen. He really has to uh listen to uh all other group members in order to understand their problems, their issues, their interests in the group and maybe if the group has to find uh a solution altogether um he can um bring in his thoughts and he can also compare them to the um to the thoughts of the uh community. Um so if he is able to listen, um he's he would be also able to um create new ideas and he can um also lead um the group um which I uh think is an important quality too. But the most important quality is the quality to listen.
