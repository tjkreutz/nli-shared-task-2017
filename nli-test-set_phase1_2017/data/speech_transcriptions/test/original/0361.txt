So I had the opportunity to stay with a host family in the United States and watch their children. I I was given a chance to look into the life of an American family and see the different tra- different traditions and uh daily life um compared to my life what I what I was used to. Um beside from the fact I um learned a lot of English. I really improved my English ability, my English knowledge, my English vocabulary, the ability to speak and respond to questions and have conversations.
