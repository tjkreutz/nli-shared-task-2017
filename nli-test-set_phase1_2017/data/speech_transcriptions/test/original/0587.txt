From six months ago I was uh relocated from my company <%> for my assignment in Thailand to uh Japan. Uh Japan is a very interesting and challenging working environment and I'm very glad that I'm general manager of a lot of facility and that I'm able to experience all these different cultural influences. Tokyo is a really new challenge for me I think <%> Tokyo is is by far more crowded and the Japanese culture offers uh many specilities which uh will take me some more months to be more familiar with it. Uh I think that in a in a few months I will be more happy here.
