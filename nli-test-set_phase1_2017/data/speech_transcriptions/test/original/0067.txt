The most special opportunity that was given to me was that one that I can study in the Politecnico di Milano. This is the best university in Italy for my faculty, probably is the best city in Italy. Living in Milano is very expensive so I'm grateful to my parents that they made to to me to study in this city. Also having the opportunity to attend the most successful university in Italy gives me the opportunity to getting to the work of work very easily.
