I can choose a job, I prefer to be a tour guide because first because to be a <%> tour guide, I can travel a lot and also and I can go to visit at some places I never been to. It's a it's a it's so cool. The second uh reason, I think during the trip I can take a lot of photos. I do love taking photos so uh maybe I can take some very beautiful or very excellent photos maybe I can get uh some rewar- rewards from my photos. And finally, I think also I can eat a lot of uh delicious food I never I never tried so that's the reason why I want to be a tour guide.
