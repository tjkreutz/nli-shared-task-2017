I think teamwork is the quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team because it's the team spirit only when we have the only team spirit. Then uh it uh reflects on uh every person of the team when they are different uh linguistic people then it easy for a team member to coordinate with them when it have when they when he have the team work. Also teamwork uh leads for uh our development, and also uh we can learn more in a team rather than being a single person. It's uh very good quality.
