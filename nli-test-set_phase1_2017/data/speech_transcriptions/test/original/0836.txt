I think that uh a good opportunity or special opportunity that was given to me was the one to study in an international school here in Minnesota. Um it has not only allowed me to study English and learn English but I have also been exposed to many different cultures uh because of the very varied population of the school. Um I have met people from many different nationalities and been able to expose myself to many different cultures um as well as being able to read, write and understand the English language.
