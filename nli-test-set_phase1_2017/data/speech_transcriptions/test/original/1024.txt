At home when I'm away miss in general my friends, my family and m- more specific my uh some good food. And very important my friends are very for me I definitely uh miss this people because because like they mean a lot to me and I got a lot of good friends here in Berlin. Second my family um I like to be around my family and have to around me as well and it's good to have me around them. And uh therefore my mother comes in because she is responsible for good food and such a good cook and when I'm away uh I don't get good food as um as far as myself wanted to have it. And therefore I miss some good food when I'm away from home like very much.
