One of the things I miss most when I'm away from home are my friends. Um this is because I spend a lot of time with my friends going out, having a coffee, chatting and also discussing problems. So I would probably miss people uh with who I could discuss my problems and also speak about things we like and dislike. I would also miss my family because of course also my family has a big role in my social life and um one other last thing I would miss a lot is the soccer because I love to play soccer and I practice a lot of times. So I think this is the, these are the three things that I would miss the most.
