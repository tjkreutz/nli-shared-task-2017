I would talk to that uh book which is talking about uh how to use his time uh in life because most people uh in our societies uh use time uh to work and to seek about what they did every day in work and they don't think about um what is really important um in their life. Uh for instance uh their family or what they really think about uh about life and um um and this as I though this book was very interest.
