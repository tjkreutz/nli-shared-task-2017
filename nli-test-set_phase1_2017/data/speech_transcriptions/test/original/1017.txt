I would like to talk about a book named Twenty Years and One Day and written by <%>. I decided to uh re- read it when I moved to Spain eight month ago and to become more familiar with the local culture and history. This book really interested me because it was made based on a true story um that happened to the writer writer during uh Spanish Civil War uh thirty years ago. Um so the writer uh in this book talks about his own experience uh.
