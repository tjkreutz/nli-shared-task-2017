An interesting book that I read was <%>. I read it when I was in Junior high. It was the story of the author that she's traveled because her friends had left her. So, anyway it was the story of her, I mean her methods and the courage to get over that situation. Uh I was having hard time at the time as similar as hers. So, it gave me a lot of courage to get over it. So, it's the most interesting book that I have ever read in my life.
