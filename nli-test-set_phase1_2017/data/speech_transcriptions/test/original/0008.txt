Think about my A level examination, this is this was very important for me because it provides me a way to university which provides me way to a new job. The time during the A level examination was not easy for me. I had some problems with teachers and with school colleagues because I'm an introverted type and so I must learn how to interact with people and how to interact with my teachers but never the less I get a very a get a very good A level examination and so the hard work was okay for this aim.
