If my friend from another country is going to spend time in my country I would like to welcome uh Gongju for that person. Uh because the city as a whole is a tour site so there are a lot of things to see and enjoy. Um those things uh represent South Korea very well. So I think it's appropriate for the foreigners to visit. Second um there are many convenient things for the foreigners to to- tour. So the foreigners can enjoy the place without any inconvenience.
