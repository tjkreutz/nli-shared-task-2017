One big opportunity that was given me was um that I could work for a friend of mine in his uh clothing store because uh this was a big responsibility for me because it was a friend and I was uh chosen out of many uh friends of his to uh um connect with him and start the business with him. And um since it was not just uh any any job that anyone else could have done but it was a lot of uh responsibility. This was um  what I would call a big opportunity because I could prove myself and could prove this not to uh big company or something but to a friend of mine and uh.
