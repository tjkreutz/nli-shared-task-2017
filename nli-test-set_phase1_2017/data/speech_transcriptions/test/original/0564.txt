I would suggest a friend to definitely see Berlin because it's the capital of Germany and it's also very big city with a lot of interesting um things to see for example um monuments or um yeah attractions that are typical for the city and it's also uh a place with uh where people can go with lots of different interests for example um friends of mine could also go there to do shopping if they'd like to and go see in rest- go eat in restaurants and go to museums and so I think Berlin would be the perfect place.
