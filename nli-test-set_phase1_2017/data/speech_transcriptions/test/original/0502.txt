Away from home, what I be missing the most is my mom, my family and uh yeah not to forget the home made food. Uh I've been all these a lot. Uh I've been away from home for quite long. Uh I've been uh away from my post graduate uh course which <%> and my home is in <%> so I was uh missing all of them. I was missing the whole uh family family atmosphere, the discussions we have uh during the tea time with my uh say with my parents and uh apart from that, I also miss my uh my room and my teddy bear that's present in the room a lot. And uh yeah, I feel uh these are the most uh, these are the things that I miss the most away from home.
