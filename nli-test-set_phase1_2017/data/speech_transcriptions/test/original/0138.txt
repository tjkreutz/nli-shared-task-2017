Time of my schooling it was actually, probably during my ninth standard that a special opportunity that was given to me was, I was asked uh to be MC for the private party that we are supposed to give ou- our seniors. And it was very special because I was not known about that and my principal had so much faith on me, he has so much confidence on me that he asked me to the M- to be the MC of that particular function right on the spot as, as the function got begin he just called me up said "You've got to be the MC of this particular function." And the master of ceremony, being the master of ceremony we have lots of responsibilities and I discharged all the responsibilities right keeping of my faith, keeping of the faith of my principal and that wa- that is where I excelled.
