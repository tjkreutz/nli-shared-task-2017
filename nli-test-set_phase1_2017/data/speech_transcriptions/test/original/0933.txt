So when I'm away what I miss the most is uh my mother because uh I cannot see her that much when I'm in Paris. Uh I also miss my CDs and my books and most of all it's also the ideal atmosphere you have at home, it's really warm and comfy so that's what I miss the most when I'm abroad. I also miss of course my friends who cannot come all the time uh with me on vacation so that's always also really important to me. And it's horrible to say but I miss TV a lot so that's all I think I could say.
