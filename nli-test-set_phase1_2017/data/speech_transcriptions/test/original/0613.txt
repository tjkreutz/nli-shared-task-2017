Only through commitment to the team can he do this, um he should be uh willing to help with members of the team and uh uh this should be such I mean the team member's quality should be such that it helps the team grow and uh effectively is the uh is the contribution of each person of the team. That contributions of of the team. So commitment to the team is one quality which I think is most required and is valuable.
