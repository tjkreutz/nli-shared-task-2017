First of all to start my response, I would like to say that I've been raising I've been raised in Denmark all my life so I've been used to the Danish system, I would say. I had the opportunity to come to France two years ago to study abroad, to study at the University of Lyon which was a big experience for me two years ago as I had problems adapting to the French system. After two years I've been able to understand and adapt myself to this system which is far different from the one I've been raised in. But it's very good experience for me now and I learned a lot from it.
