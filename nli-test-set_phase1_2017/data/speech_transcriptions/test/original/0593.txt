Three years ago I had the opportunity to go to work in Australia uh with a scholarship proposed by my university. It was a great opportunity for me. First it was uh to learn English uh to improve my English, but most of all I believe that was an amazing uh opportunity for me to know better a foreign country is so far country for mine. The Australia that was in wonderful country so different from uh Europe. So big than Europe. So I really enjoy and appreciated that experience.
