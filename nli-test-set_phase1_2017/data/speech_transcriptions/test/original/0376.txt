An opportunity that was given to me uh during my first year was taken seminar in my class and that was especially in microbiology. Lecturer was quite impressed in the way I speak and probably uh that might be the very one reason what made her to uh choose me to take up the seminar. And uh I uh I made uh my point clear in the way I expressed that seminar and almost all my friends have appreciated me and uh probably my parents also made me to improve myself. I think this would be the better way to improve on language and apart from that we can also understand uh the ability how we can improve ourselves and for our students.
