The accomplishment that required me to work very hard is the preparation for a project for a PhD in the University of Trento. Um it's very hard because uh it's on ICT topics, uh information and communication technology and uh it's not uh um it's not properly my my topic so I have to find books in the several libraries uh in uh around Italy, and to reads lot of text uh also in English and French, and after to write a short essay of five or six pages uh it's short but very defined and um and so it's bad.
