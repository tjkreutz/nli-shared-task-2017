Special opportunity given to me was to organize the graduation day celebrations of my college. It was very special occasion because even I was graduating. The main part was to develop lots of parts in this uh graduation day celebration which I had to accomplish. First of all I had to invite all the graduates uh who had already passed out, and I had to email all of them not uh just from my class but also from the other sections, other classes, and from other departments. After uh emailing them and inviting them for the celebration I had to arrange for the graduation uh suits and arrange for the chief guest and rest- and also for the uh food items. It was cumbersome but I succeeded in doing well.
