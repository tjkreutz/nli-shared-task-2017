I would bring him or to Osaka Japan because in  Osaka there are many places to shop to in the <%> es- especially in the city. You can go you can go and buy a lot of different kind of clothes, pants and even places to eat. There a lot of Italian restaurants, Japanese restaurant and even Chinese restaurant. And I also like to bring them Osaka because I like the way they speak Japanese. The way they speak Japanese is different from other places because they have uh they have a different slang. So that's the reason why I want to bring him or her to Osaka.
