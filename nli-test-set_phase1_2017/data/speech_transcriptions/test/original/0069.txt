A special opportunity for me is studying abroad. When I was a senior I couldn't decide what I should do in the future between getting a job or studying more. At that time my professor advised me that you should do your future you should decide your future according to your aptitude. So I could decide to study go abroad. Fortunately my parents agreed my opinion so they are supposed to give financial support. For this reason the studying go abroad is my special opportunity.
