I would suggest them for visiting the city of Guangzouh. um there are to reasons for this suggestion, the first is that it is a clean city and we can breath fresh air. It's very different from some big cities in the country. Additionally there are some temples in the city. It is quiet in the temples and we can think out own questions alone in the temples. That's why I suggest them to visit the city of Guangzhou.
