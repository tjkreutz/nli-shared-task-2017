In the beginning it was very difficult for me because I didn't speak the language very well. But now uh like as I see myself I can do better like than before. That I can speak more English <%>, I gained more vocabulary than before. When I got to my school there my reading age was like about nine years old and I was sixteen so I had a special program to to work on for two months so I can get my reading age up to the age that I was in which is sixteen years old. And I <%> did it.
