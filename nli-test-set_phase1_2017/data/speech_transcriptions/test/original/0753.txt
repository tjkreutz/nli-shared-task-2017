After graduating from high school in Germany I got the opportunity to broaden my knowledge about other cultures before starting my studies uh in eco- economics in Germany. For this reason I decided to spend a year in America uh which I split up to six months at the west coast in San Francisco, and the other six month at the east coast in Miami. In fact I learned a lot about the American way of life especially through the many friendships I made, and I actually liked it so much that um I wanna go back there to America and uh continue my studies in economics with an MBA.
