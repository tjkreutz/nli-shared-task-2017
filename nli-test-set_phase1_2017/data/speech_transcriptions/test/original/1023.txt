An accomplishment that required required me to work very hard was an assignment provided by the school when I was in New Zealand. It was graphics assignment and it required me to write so many pictures draw so many pictures by using rulers and compasses and uh I actually ever done things before. So it was very hard to do graphic assignment. And also I had to prepare my equipment and it took a while to complete equipment.
