Well the last interesting book I read was a sci-fi because it allows you to evade and escape in another world. You are cut from, cut out from the the world you're living in it's a just a way to leave the um intellectual imagination be free. Um it's allows you to live in another world you maybe um feel as you're the main character and to live his uh his adventure. That's why I uh find this book was interesting.
