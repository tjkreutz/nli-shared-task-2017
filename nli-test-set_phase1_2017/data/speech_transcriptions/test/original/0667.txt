The special opportunity that was given to me was to help uh blind woman to cross uh the road. It was a social service which is a thing that one does for having a feeling of good doing something good for the humanity. She was as a city of a very crowded. Uh she was not able to cross. I feel very pity on her as she was not able to cross the road and no was uh coming forward to help her. So I hold her hand and made her cross the road. She held she held uh she really thanked me. That was the opportunity in my life that was given to me and I was very thankful to it.
