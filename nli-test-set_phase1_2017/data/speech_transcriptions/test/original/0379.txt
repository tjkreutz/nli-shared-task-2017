Uh one of the interesting books that I have read lately was the No Logo by Naomi Klein. She has uh very interesting the points regarding um International business promotion branding and how it's dominating our culture our life in general. And um the cooperate scandals and their impact on todays society and um I think the book was very rewarding to have an um critical view on how businesses operate and to appreciate on the other hand the common the new practices of cooperate social responsibility. Um cooperate social responsibility is one of my interest areas that's why I really like the book No Logo. One of the Ironies of the book.
