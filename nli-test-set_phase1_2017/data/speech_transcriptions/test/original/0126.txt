So uh and the thing I miss most about uh when I'm away from my home it's uh it's simply my family because I'm really close to to my parents and to my two brothers and sisters because uh I have spend a lot of time with them when I was a child and the they are really important in uh in my life because uh I like spending time with them around the table and talking about our lives and uh. So and uh I'm aware for example uh when I travel there I I take time to to phone, to call them and uh to trying to having some news from them because yeah, uh I miss them a lot.
