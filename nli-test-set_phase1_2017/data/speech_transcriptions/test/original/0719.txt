The most interesting book that I have read recently is the Da Vinci Code written by Dan Brown. The book challenges the theory as the theory of evolution of Jesus as presented by the ancient church. It is an interesting narration that involves certain characters and intermingles them exactly with this theory uh the way the author wants to present it. The book presents interesting points about how uh Jesus was born and contradicts various theories that the church had presented to us and what we were aware of. Thus the book is an interesting narration as well as enlightening and providing great information about things that would.
