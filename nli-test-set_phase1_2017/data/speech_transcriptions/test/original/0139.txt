My former Italian law firm gave me the best opportunity to attend an internship of nearly one year American law firm. That's why right now I'm attending uh I'm living in New York and I'm uh attending this internship in the a manag- uh management position group. This was the best opportunity I could wish be- wha- for the following reason. I can improve my English proficiency, I can see the structure of the agreements that American firm use and from which Italian firm have have taken a benchmark to draft our agreement. So I can improve my pref- professional skills, English skills.
