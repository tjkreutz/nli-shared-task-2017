Uh I become a teacher in a primary school. I like this job because my father is a teacher and I respect my father very much. And I, second I would uh like to teach knowledge to the student uh it help me feel uh I'm a useful man. Third, I as a teacher I can stay with the student, their their worry their age is very low and uh also let me feel um I'm still you- I'm still a young man. For all of these reasons, I think this is a very special opportunity for me. That's all.
