Well the book I speak <%> from Frank Albert. I read it when I was young but uh I think it uh really moved me and it was very important for me to read. And what I mostly like about this book is the main character. And then you can see his evolution from time so he grows from a young man to a real leader and you can see all his doubts, his beliefs, emotions. First he loses his family but then he <%> and uh he learns had to be accepted and considered as a living <%>. So its very uh good.
