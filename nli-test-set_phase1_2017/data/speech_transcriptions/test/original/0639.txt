One of the most interesting books that I have read is Many Masters Many Lives by Dr. Brian Weiss. He talks of life after dead and reiterate the fact that we don't only live once and that we live even after dying and that's the that real soul. I found it very interesting because Dr. Brian Weiss with the help of para-psychiatry interviewed many of his patients. They revealed past experiences. Past experiences not only related to their um infant age as in during the real stage and during the field stage but also of their past lives. They could narrate everything what they remember.
