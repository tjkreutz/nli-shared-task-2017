In my opinion I do really miss abou- abou- about our home is my room. First because it contains my personal things uh that's related to my life, to my school, everything including uh friends uh like pictures of our uh graduations, pictures of uh birthday parties. All are sticking on the walls so I really really miss it. In addition to that, uh I really miss the relieve because I I really I am when I was in my home, I feel really better than going away to different world without knowing what I'm doing there.
