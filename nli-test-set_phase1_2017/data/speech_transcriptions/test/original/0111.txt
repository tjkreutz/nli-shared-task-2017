In my personal opinion, one city that uh I would like to recommend is Tama. Because I uh gone Tama like uh two months ago. And I uh spend a a beautiful uh time there. Tama is a is a place where uh you you can go to to relax yourself and also enjoy of different places. For example, there and uh different church historical churches and markets where you can buy uh a gifts for your friends, for example. And also, Tama has a a really nice weather. It's not too hot and uh it's not cold. That's why I think Tama you have to visit Tama.
