Well, one of those special opportunity that was given to me and it will remain with me throughout my life life time happ- and it is a very great moment. It was when I was named captain of my school football team. It was a great moment for me. It helped me build my character, it helped me to produce know me know myself. It helped me to discipline other players and to know their commitment. It helped me to uh have leadership qualities. This was a very special opportunity and it was a great responsibility. I had to do a lot of work to be uh able to uh live up to the opportunity. It was a great opportunity for me and for the team itself.
