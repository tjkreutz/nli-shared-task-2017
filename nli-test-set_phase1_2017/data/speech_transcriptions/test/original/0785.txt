<%> most treasured special opportunities that I was given was to give a oral presentation for a research paper at the Indian Pharmaceutical Congress. Um it is a very well known um congress that takes place every year and I got the opportunity um to go and present a research paper that I had worked for. It is a very prestigious opportunity as very few students are selected for this thing. Also um I was appreciated and um my efforts were paid off as I was the youngest student to give such kind of a presentation.
