Travel abroad especially in the United States and it was very important uh to me because well it allows me to uh discover a new c- a new uh culture which is uh similar to the European one but uh quite uh different in some ways. Uh the other um the other reason that the opportunity was important for me is that uh it gives me the opportunity to uh learn the language so uh getting to used to it and being fluent uh in uh in speaking and also in writing. And uh now is very important to speak at least two language. And the other uh the other advantage of this this opportunity was to meet new people and to create a network.
