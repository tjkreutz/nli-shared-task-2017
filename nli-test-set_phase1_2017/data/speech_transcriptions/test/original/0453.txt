Well, that depends on which are plan uh my friends' plans if they are interest in <%> archaeological um structures, for example I I would ready to go to Chiapas or Wahaca which are both uh Mexican <%> states. Um anyway, if they prefer to uh rest, I would recommend to go to uh a Mexican beach, for example Cancún or Acapulco. Um anyway um also Uh Mexico city, that's my first recommendation uh because I live there and I know the city and I know it's fun.
