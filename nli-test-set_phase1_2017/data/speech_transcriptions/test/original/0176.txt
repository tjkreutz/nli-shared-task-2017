I think that first responsibility is an important quality for a valuable member of a team. Especially, for example, in a sports uh it is important to have responsible team members just for meeting at a certain time, you have to be on time in order to have a same process in the group. Um responsibility is uh necessary in order for a group to work together because when one person doesn't feel responsible for the rest of the group or for the team outcome, it is um hard for the rest, for the team to to get to the level they could get to if.
