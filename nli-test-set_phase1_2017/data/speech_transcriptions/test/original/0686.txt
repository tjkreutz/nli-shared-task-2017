About uh two years ago I had the opportunity to work with <%>. It was a great opportunity. I'm still working with them. And it it was a great opportunity because I was planning to go out of the country to study, but then I had this opportunity I stayed here. I've been having a lot of a great experience in my my work. I've been uh uh growing up and I've learned a lot of things that uh have given me a great experience here in Colombia so that I can go to Canada to study next year.
