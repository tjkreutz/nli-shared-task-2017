I do believe it is very important that one has the the quality of respect in order to be able to work efficiently in teams. In fact you cannot participate with others if you do not have the capacity to listen to what they say and to base your judgments on facts rather than just on simple opinions because the person is different. You need to be able to accept the difference and that is part of respect. You also need to be able to contribute fully to a team as you want to achieve a common goal and that is part of respect as well. You need to respect people in what they do. To respect yourself in what you do and all of that to be able to be able to do an efficient work.
