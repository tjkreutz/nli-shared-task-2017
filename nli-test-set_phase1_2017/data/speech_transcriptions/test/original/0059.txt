A time I was given the opportunity to uh study for one year in Germany. Uh this opportunity was very important to me because uh it uh gave me the um opportunity of lear- of learning a new language such as German and to uh meet people from uh other countries of uh Europe. Uh uh I was uh uh in Berlin and uh I studied at the uh university in the faculty of law. Uh uh there in Berlin I met many people and I made many new friends.
