Well I suggest I will suggest they visit the Glacier Perito Moreno that is in uh the west of Argentina. It is a very interesting place and it's awesome. It's very very very nice because it has its huge ices and landscape. All the surroundings is is very nice. It has trees full uh it's full of trees, uh green trees, pines and all of them and there is a river and it's amazing how the river uh breaks the these glacier  and it's the only moving glacier around the world. That moving glacier is is a glacier that increase and decreases every year. It's very fascinating place to visit.
