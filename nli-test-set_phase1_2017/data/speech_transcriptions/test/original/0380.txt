Well one of the most special opportunities I've, have had is working for an international laboratory of <%> medicines, it was called <%>. It was really important because I got the chance to meet really nice people and to do what I prepared five years of college for. I also had the opportunity to use my languages because I was uh sort of liaison between the laboratory of France and laboratory of Germany so I had to be in contact with them and it was, was really interesting thing to do.
