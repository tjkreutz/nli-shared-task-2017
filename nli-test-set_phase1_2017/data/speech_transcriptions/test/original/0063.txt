Opportunity that I was given was to postpone of an exam that I had to take in a special uh in an exact time. They postpone it because I was representing my school in uh uh chess chess matches and they gi- give me that time of postpone because of the uh representation. I it is a great honor for me to have that to be in that team and it was the best opportunity. Um on the other hand I couldn't study for the exam, if I get into the exam I would get a lower grade and that will affect my high school GPA.
