What I would miss uh most about my home would be of course my family and my friends. I would love to talk with them when I'm away I would love to hug them before saying hello or good-bye. Yeah and just drinking coffee, sharing company with them, hanging around with them and just have a good time. Getting good advices from them, um sharing opinions and and time together, watching together TV or going to the cinema. Just um basically sharing a lot of time of the day together and listening to them, how they are what they are doing, what they are up to and sharing a big part of my life with them. This is what I miss most about my home when I'm away in someway or somehow.
