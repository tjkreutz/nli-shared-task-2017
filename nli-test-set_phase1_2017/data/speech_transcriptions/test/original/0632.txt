I am a good hostel, a border who's been staying in hostel for almost in the last ten to eleven years. But still I miss my home a lot. I miss home food, homely atmosphere, people, my parents and everything ever. The friends with whom I've shared my childhood, the nearby places. But the most important factor which I miss is being with my dad. My dad who's been my mentor and who's supported me throughout. He is the one whom I feel like talking to always when I'm in trouble. So whenever I am in trouble when I'm not in at home or in hostel, I definitely feel like talking to my dad and.
