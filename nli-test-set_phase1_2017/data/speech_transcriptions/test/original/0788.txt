Well I'm away from my home, one thing that I really miss is the food prepared by mom. I u- I love the fo- uh food prepared my my mom, by my mother and specifically the chicken curry. When I'm away I strive to get that food and really feel miserable when I don't have it. I grew up eating the food prepared by mother and I cherish to have the memory of it. That's that's all.
