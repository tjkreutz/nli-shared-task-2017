Whenever I graduated from the university, I applied to a well known Turkish construction company uh to get emp- employed uh and they have accepted my uh application and it was a very good opportunity for me for uh such a young freshman fresh graduate from the university. Uh and it was a nice car- uh career for me uh be- because the construction company was one of the leading construction companies, uh not only in the in my country but also in the world. So it was a good beginning for me.
